	patterns

Carve out a release by serving a file system based on my CVS working
directory and creating a tar archive of its contents.  The patterns
file contains regular expressions that describe the files to serve: To
make it in to the release, a file must match a + expression and not
match any - expressions.

# start server
srvfs -P patterns releasefs /usr/swasey/src/work/ml96

# mount and take a look
Local mount /srv/releasefs /n/test

# mount and create archive
v=1.1
mount /srv/releasefs /n/tilt-$v
cd /n; tar c tilt-$v | gzip -9 > /tmp/tilt-$v.tar.gz

# kill server
kill exportfs|rc; rm -f /srv/releasefs
