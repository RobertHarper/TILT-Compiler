This file serves as an overview log for modifications to the TILT
compiler.  Starting date is April 20, 1998.

In discussing the reifier, Perry and I came to the following
conclusions:

 (1) We would like to remove the code in the back-end (in particular,
     in tortl) that determines the tracability of values through type
     normalization, since this is redundent; the reifier already has
     to do all this computation.

 (2) In order for this to be possible, the reifier must annotate every
     subexpression with tracability info (since each subexpression
     corresponds to an RTL/MLRISC pseudoregister needing a tracability
     annotation).  

 (3) Adding annotation nodes to our program is clumsy, and the
     information is hard to maintain.  Therefore, we will add
     tracability annotations to expression-level let bindings, and
     have the reifier emit (term-level) A-normalized code.

 (4) The tracability annotation should be something like

         datatype trace_annot = UNKNOWN
                              | TRACE_KNOWN of <abstract trace info>
                              | TRACE_COMPUTE of <short path>

     where we assume the reifier is parameterized by a function

         get_trace : Nil.context * Nil.con -> <abstract trace info> option

     which returns SOME xxx if the tracability of values of this type
     can be determined statically (for now, if the head-normal form is
     known) and NONE otherwise.  If NONE is returned it is the
     reifier's responsibility to bind the constructor to a variable so
     that the type (and hence the tracability) will be available at
     run-time.

 (5) Adding code to the reifier to do a-normalization as it goes seems
     rather redundent at the moment; especially since Perry is
     currently working on Stephanie's CSE optimizer, which also requires
     A-normal form.  We therefore intend to either keep the program in
     A-normal form or normalize it just before calling these two
     passes.  In particular, I'll write the reifier to assume the
     input has been normalized.

April 21-22 Perry

	
	I incorporated Morgan's hoister and Stephanie's ExpTable
into TILT.  Also, the linearizer now actually linearizes as well
as renames.  The optimizer has been enahnced to perform CSE.
Preliminary results indicates that linearization, hosisting, and CSE
decrease code size by 10-20%.

	Using A-normal form on constructors and terms help
hoisting and CSE but a-normalizing types can have a deleterious 
effect on compilation time.  By just anormalizing types,
we can end up with many occurrences of Let_c types which require
a lot of work to reduce back to head-normal form.  This may not be 
so bad if the bindings are lifted followed by un-a-normalizing the types.
For some test files, naively anormalizing types causes the optimizer
to take twice as long and tortl to take four times as long.

	In experimenting with the optimizations, I discovered two
bugs.  First, the closure converter does not handle free variables
of type floating-point.  Second, tortl does not handle top-level
variables of type floating-point.  As a workaround, I have disabled the
hoister and CSE for unboxed floating-point terms.
