|Sensible Structure Sharing for Standard ML|
 ------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

The topic of structure sharing came up a while back in the context of
the TILT compiler, and we spent quite a bit of time heatedly hashing
this out.  The consensus was that structure sharing as defined by the
Definition is overly restrictive to the point of being useless, since
you can rarely share structures whose signatures contain any type
definitions.  SML/NJ extends the Definition to allow sharing between
structures whose signatures are the same signature *variable*.  This
seems to cover most cases that come up in practice, but the limitation
to signature variables was felt to be somewhat arbitrary.  In
addition, it seems strange that one cannot replace an occurrence of a
signature variable with the signature it is supposed to abbreviate.

In this note, we will present our proposal for sensible structure
sharing.  It is a conservative extension of both the Definition and
SML/NJ.  First, we will go into some detail on the Definition of type
and structure sharing, for those not intimately familiar with the
details.  Some terminology given here (some from the Definition, some
of our own) will be important in the subsequent description of our
proposal.


The Details of the Problem
--------------------------

1) How is structure sharing Defined?

The Definition says that the structure sharing specification

> spec sharing A1 = ... = An

is a derived form that expands out to "spec" modified by a series of
type sharing constraints, each of the form

> sharing type Ai.longtycon = Aj.longtycon

for every pair of longtycons Ai.longtycon and Aj.longtycon specified
by the spec such that 1 <= i < j <= n.  Below, we will refer to any
such pair as "type components of the same name".  This leads us to:

2) How is type sharing Defined?

The problem is that type sharing constraints are only permitted
between abstract types defined in the spec.  Actually, the Definition
is slightly looser: type sharing is permitted only between type
components that denote "flexible type names" of the same "arity".  A
flexible type name is an abstract type name that was introduced by the
spec being constrained.  The arity of a type is the number of type
variables it is parameterized over.  For example, consider the spec

> type s
> type t = s
> type u
> type v = u

Introducing a sharing type constraint between any two types here is
legal because all of them are equal to abstract types introduced by
the spec.  (Sharing between (s and u), (s and v) or (t and v) would
introduce a sharing constraint between s and u, and any other sharing
would add no constraints.)  Now, consider the following spec:

> type s
> type t = s * s
> type u
> type v = u * u

The only legal sharing type constraint we can add to this spec is
between s and u, because neither t nor v denotes a flexible type name.
We will say that the "flexible type components" of a spec are the
longtycons defined by the spec that denote flexible type names.  It
should be noted that the set of flexible types of a spec remains the
same after a sharing type constraint is introduced --- the sharing has
the effect of equating the type names that each flexible type denotes,
but they are still flexible.

So, in summary, the problem is that sharing between structures that
have any non-flexible (for instance, transparent) type components of
the same name, will expand into a bunch of sharing type constraints,
including some between the non-flexible components, which are illegal.
This seems overly restrictive: at a minimum, it seems silly not to be
able to share between two structures that have *equivalent*
signatures.


Our Proposal
------------

The core proposal is that structure sharing will induce type sharing
constraints between all pairs of flexible type components of the same
name and arity (and only those components).  In other words, it will
only expand into the type sharing constraints that are guaranteed to
be legal.  This completely defines what spec is generated from the
structure sharing constraint.

The remainder of the proposal involves what extra "sanity" checks are
performed after the sharing between the flexible components has been
added to the spec.  There are two variations to this, both of which
are implemented in almost exactly the same way.  The plan is to make
the choice between them a flag in the compiler.

In both variations, any pair of non-flexible type components of the
same name and arity which denote equivalent types (or type
constructors) will be silently accepted.  This allows for the
signatures of two structures being shared to contain transparent type
definitions, so long as they are equivalent.

In the first variation, all other pairs of type components of the same
name will generate a compiler warning.

In the second variation, all other pairs of type components of the
same name will generate a compiler error.

So for example, consider the following varieties of behavior for

> structure A : sig A_spec end
> structure B : sig B_spec end
> sharing A = B

depending on what A_spec and B_spec are:

A_spec          B_spec		variation 1	variation 2
--------------------------------------------------------------
type t		type t		A.t = B.t	A.t = B.t
--------------------------------------------------------------
type t = int	type t = int	silent accept	silent accept
--------------------------------------------------------------
type t		type t = int	warning		reject (error)
--------------------------------------------------------------
type t = int	type t = bool	warning		reject (error)


Discussion
----------

1) It is important that the sharing between the flexible components be
added to the spec first, before the extra checks are performed.  For
example, consider the following:

> structure A : sig type t type s = t * int end
> structure B : sig type t type s = t * int end
> sharing A = B

In this case, A.s and B.s are only equivalent *after* the sharing
of A.t and B.t is added to the spec, so the sharing between all
flexible type components must be added first.

2) It is worth noting that, in variation 1, structure sharing is
always legal; the compiler may just whine a lot if you use it weirdly.

3) Why bother with the two variations?  At the time we studied this
issue, we couldn't agree on which was better and it seemed easy to
implement them both.  [Derek: If I recall correctly, I may have been
the only one who really supported variation 1 and I've now changed my
mind.]  The distinction comes up in the case that you're sharing one
type component that's flexible and one that's not.  The Definition of
course says to reject this.  One could consider implementing real
sharing here, using a "where type" or something to realize the
flexible component in terms of the non-flexible one, but it is unclear
how to do this in general.  Consider for example,

> structure A : sig type a  type t        type s = a*a end
> structure B : sig type b  type t = b*b  type s end
> sharing A = B

Therefore, we decided that no definitions would be introduced in this
case, and that the compiler would emit either a warning or an error.

The argument for raising an error is that in some sense a structure
sharing spec can be thought of as a check, in addition to simply as a
mechanism for introducing type sharing specs.  It seems
counter-intuitive that a structure sharing spec can succeed without
all of the types present in both signatures being equal.  Raising an
error means that if a sharing spec is actually accepted, then any two
type components of the same name are known to be equal.

The argument for a warning is that the programmer might wish to share
two such signatures without expecting that all of the types will be
made equal, and hence should be allowed to do so.  However, at the
least a warning is desired to indicate that not all type components
of the same name can be made equal.
