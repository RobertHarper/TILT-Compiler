  (* Constants Names and Name Preferences *)
  (****************************************)

  (*
     Names (strings) are associated with constants (cids) in two ways:
     (1) There is an array nameArray mapping constants to print names (string),
     (2) there is a hashtable sgnHashTable mapping identifiers (strings) to constants.

     The mapping from constants to their print names must be maintained
     separately from the global signature, since constants which have
     been shadowed must be marked as such when printing.  Otherwise,
     type checking can generate very strange error messages such as
     "Constant clash: c <> c".

     In the same table we also record the fixity property of constants,
     since it is more a syntactic then semantic property which would
     pollute the lambda-calculus core.

     The mapping from identifers (strings) to constants is used during
     parsing.

     There are global invariants which state the mappings must be
     consistent with each other.
