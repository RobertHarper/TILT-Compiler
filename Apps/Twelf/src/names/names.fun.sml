  (*
     Names (strings) are associated with constants (cids) in two ways:
     (1) There is an array nameArray mapping constants to print names (string),
     (2) there is a hashtable sgnHashTable mapping identifiers (strings) to constants.

     The mapping from constants to their print names must be maintained
     separately from the global signature, since constants which have
     been shadowed must be marked as such when printing.  Otherwise,
     type checking can generate very strange error messages such as
     "Constant clash: c <> c".

     In the same table we also record the fixity property of constants,
     since it is more a syntactic then semantic property which would
     pollute the lambda-calculus core.

     The mapping from identifers (strings) to constants is used during
     parsing.

     There are global invariants which state the mappings must be
     consistent with each other.

  (* Variable Names *)
  (******************)

  (*
     Picking variable names is tricky, since we need to avoid capturing.
     This is entirely a matter of parsing and printing, since the
     internal representation relies on deBruijn indices and explicit
     substitutions.

     During parsing, a name is resolved as follows:
       lower case id => bound variable, constant, error
       upper case id => bound variable, constant, free variable
     where a free variable could become either an FVar
     (in constant declarations) or an EVar (in queries).

     Names are either given by the declaration or query itself, or
     assigned as late as possible.  For example, EVars which are never
     printed are never assigned a name.

     This may be a problem for contexts: if a name is not assigned when
     a declaration is entered into the context, terms in this context
     may not be printable.  Function decName below guarantees that new
     names are assigned to variables added to a context.
  *)

  (*
     There are three data structures:
     1. varTable mapping names (strings) to EVars and FVar types
     2. evarList mapping EVars to names (string)
     3. indexTable mapping base names B to integer suffixes to generate
        new names B1, B2, ...
