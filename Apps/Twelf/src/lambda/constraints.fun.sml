  (*
     Constraints cnstr are of the form (X<I>[s] = U).
     Invariants:
       G |- s : G'  G' |- X<I> : V
       G |- U : W
       G |- V[s] == W : L
       (X<>,s) is whnf, but X<>[s] is not a pattern
     If X<I> is uninstantiated, the constraint is inactive.
     If X<I> is instantiated, the constraint is active.

     Constraints are attached directly to the EVar X
     or to a descendent  -fp?

    (* simplify Eqns = Eqns'
       Effects: simplifies the constraints in Eqns by removing constraints
         of the form U = U' where G |- U == U' : V (mod beta/eta)
         Neither U nor U' needs to be a pattern
