Type and Strictness Checking
Author: Carsten Schuermann

Type-checking is separate from type reconstruction performed during
parsing.  It verifies internal invariants an is enabled by the
variable Global.doubleCheck, which means that it will be called
after type reconstruction and after every step in the theorem
prover.  Very expensive!

It is used as a fail-safe run-time check on internal data structures.
