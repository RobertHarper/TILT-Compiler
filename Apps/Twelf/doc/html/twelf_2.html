<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC4">2  Lexical Conventions</A></H1>

<P>
Lexical analysis of Twelf has purposely been kept simple, with few
reserved characters and identifiers.  As a result one may need to use
more whitespace to separate identifiers than in other languages.  For
example, <SAMP>`A-&#62;B'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`A+B'</SAMP> are single identifiers, while <SAMP>`A
-&#62; B'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`A + B'</SAMP> both consist of 3 identifiers.

</P>
<P>
During parsing, identifiers are resolved as reserved identifiers,
constants, bound variables, or free variables, following the usual rules
of static scoping in lambda-calculi.

The following table lists the reserved characters in Twelf.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`:'</SAMP>
<DD>
    colon, constant declaration or ascription

<DT><SAMP>`.'</SAMP>
<DD>
    period, terminates declarations

<DT><SAMP>`('</SAMP> <SAMP>`)'</SAMP>
<DD>
    parentheses, for grouping terms

<DT><SAMP>`['</SAMP> <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>
<DD>
    brackets, for lambda abstraction

<DT><SAMP>`{'</SAMP> <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>
<DD>
    braces, for quantification (dependent function types)

<DT><VAR>whitespace</VAR>
<DD>
    separates identifiers; one of space, newline, tab, carriage return,
    vertical tab or formfeed

<DT><SAMP>`%'</SAMP>
<DD>
    introduces comments or special keyword declarations

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`%<VAR>whitespace</VAR>'</SAMP> <SAMP>`%%'</SAMP>
<DD>
      comment terminated by the end of the line, may contain any characters

<DT><SAMP>`%{'</SAMP> <SAMP>`}%'</SAMP>
<DD>
      delimited comment, nested <SAMP>`%{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`}%'</SAMP> must match

<DT><SAMP>`%<VAR>keyword</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
      various declarations

<DT><SAMP>`%.'</SAMP>
<DD>
      end of input stream
</DL>

<DT><SAMP>`"'</SAMP>
<DD>
    doublequote, disallowed

<DT>other printing characters
<DD>
    identifier constituents
</DL>

</P>
<P>
All printing characters that are not reserved can be included in
identifiers, which are separated by whitespace or reserved characters.
In particular, <CODE>A-&#62;B</CODE> is an identifier, whereas <CODE>A -&#62; B</CODE>
stands for the type of functions from <CODE>A</CODE> to <CODE>B</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
An uppercase identifier is one which begins with an underscore <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> or
a letter in the range <SAMP>`A'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`Z'</SAMP>.  A lowercase identifier
begins with any other character except a reserved one.  Numbers also
count as lowercase identifiers and are not interpreted specially.  Free
variables in a declaration must be uppercase, bound variables and
constants may be either uppercase or lowercase identifiers.

</P>
<P>
There are also four reserved identifiers with a predefined meaning which
cannot be changed.  Keep in mind that these can be constituents of other
identifers which are not interpreted specially.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`-&#62;'</SAMP>
<DD>
          function type
<DT><SAMP>`&#60;-'</SAMP>
<DD>
          reverse function type
<DT><SAMP>`_'</SAMP>
<DD>
          hole, to be filled by term reconstruction
<DT><SAMP>`='</SAMP>
<DD>
          definition
<DT><SAMP>`type'</SAMP>
<DD>
          the kind <EM>type</EM>
</DL>

<P>
Constants have static scope, which means that they can be shadowed by
subsequent declarations.  A shadowed identifier (which can no longer be
referred to in input) is printed as <CODE>%<VAR>id</VAR>%</CODE>.  The printer for
terms renames bound variables so they do not shadow constants.

</P>
<P>
Free uppercase identifiers in declarations represent schematic
variables.  In order to distinguish them from other kinds of variables
and constants they are printed as <SAMP>`'<VAR>id</VAR>'</SAMP> (backquote, followed
by the identifer name) in error messages.
