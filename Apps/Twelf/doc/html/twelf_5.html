<P>
Twelf gives an operational interpretation to signatures under the
computation-as-proof-search paradigm.  The fundamental idea is to fix a
simple search strategy and then search for a derivation of a query
according to this strategy.  The result may be a substitution for the
free variables in a query and a derivation, or explicit failure.  It is
also possible that the computation does not terminate.

</P>
<P>
A query can be posed in three different ways: as a <CODE>%query</CODE>
declaration, as a <CODE>%solve</CODE> declaration, or interactively, using a
top-level invoked from ML with <CODE>Twelf.top</CODE> which prompts with
<SAMP>`?-'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="twelf_5.html#SEC24">5.3  Interactive Queries</A>).

</P>

<PRE>
query ::= id : term   % <EM>X : A</EM>, <EM>X</EM> a free variable
        | term        % <EM>A</EM>

bound ::= nat         % number of solutions
        | *           % unbounded number

qdecl ::= bound bound query % expected solutions, try limit, query

decl ::= ...
       | %query qdecl.      % execute query
       | %solve id : term.  % solve and name proof term
</PRE>

<P>
In all of these cases, the free variables in a query are interpreted
existentially, which is in contrast to constant declarations where free
variables are interpreted universally.  In particular, free variables
might be instantiated during type reconstruction and during execution of
the query.

</P>
<P>
The query form

</P>

<PRE>
%query <VAR>expected</VAR> <VAR>try</VAR> A.
</PRE>

<P>
will try to solve the query <CODE>A</CODE> and verify that it gives the
<VAR>expected</VAR> number of solutions, but it will never try to find more
than indicated by <VAR>try</VAR>.  It succeeds and prints a message, whose
precise form depends on the value of <CODE>Twelf.chatter</CODE> if <CODE>A</CODE>
has the expected number of solutions; otherwise it either fails with an
error message or does not terminate.  <SAMP>`%query'</SAMP> has no other effect
on the state of Twelf.  Here are some examples.

</P>

<PRE>
%query 1 * A.      % check that <CODE>A</CODE> has exactly one solution
%query 1 1 A.      % check that <CODE>A</CODE> has at least one solution
%query * 3 A.      % <CODE>A</CODE> has infinitely many solutions, check 3
%query * * A.      % fails if <CODE>A</CODE> has finitely many solutions
%query 1 0 A.      % skip this query

<A NAME="IDX59"></A>

</P>
<P>
The query form

</P>

<PRE>
%solve c : A.
</PRE>

<P>
will search for the first solution <CODE>M</CODE> of <CODE>A</CODE> and then define

</P>

<PRE>
c : A = M.
</PRE>

<P>
If there are any free variables remaining in <CODE>M</CODE> or <CODE>A</CODE> after
search, they will be implicitly quantified in the new definition.  This
form of definition is particularly useful to compute and name inputs to
future queries.  An example of this feature from the file
<TT>`examples/nd/lam.elf'</TT> can be found in section <A HREF="twelf_8.html#SEC43">8.5  Proof Realizations</A>.

</P>

</P>
<P>
An interactive top-level can be invoked using the SML expression
<CODE>Twelf.top ();</CODE>.  The top-level prompts with <SAMP>`?- '</SAMP> and
awaits the input of a query, terminated by a period <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> and
a <KBD>RET</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
After the query has been parsed, Twelf reconstructs implicit type
information, issuing a warning if constraints remain.  The result is
executed as a query.  At any point during the processing of a
query the user may interrupt with <KBD>C-c</KBD> (that is, <KBD>CTRL</KBD> and
<KBD>c</KBD>) to drop back into ML's interactive top-level.

</P>
<P>
When Twelf has found a solution, it prints the <EM>answer
substitution</EM> for all free variables in the query, including the proof
term variable if one was given.  It also notes if there are remaining
equational constraints, but currently does not print them.

</P>
<P>
The top-level then waits for input, which is interpreted as
follows

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>y</KBD>, <KBD>Y</KBD>, or <KBD>;</KBD>
<DD>
      backtrack and search for another solution

<DT><KBD>q</KBD> or <KBD>Q</KBD>
<DD>
      quit Twelf's top-level and return to ML

<DT><KBD>n</KBD>, <KBD>N</KBD>, or anything else
<DD>
      return to prompt for another query
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC25">5.4  Sample Trace</A></H2>

<P>
As an example we consider lists of propositions and some simple
operations on them, as they might be used when programming a theorem
prover.

</P>

<PRE>
list : type.
nil  : list.
cons : o -&#62; list -&#62; list.
</PRE>

<P>
First, we want to write a program to append two lists to obtain
their concatenation.  This is expressed as a relation between
the three lists, which in turn is implemented as a type family

</P>

<PRE>
append  : list -&#62; list -&#62; list -&#62; type.

appNil  : append nil K K.
appCons : append (cons X L) K (cons X M)
           &#60;- append L K M.
</PRE>

<P>
Here, we use the synonym <CODE>A &#60;- B</CODE> for <CODE>B -&#62; A</CODE> to improve
readability.  We say <EM><CODE>A</CODE> if <CODE>B</CODE></EM>.

</P>
<P>
The first sample query concatenates the singleton lists containing
<CODE>true</CODE> and <CODE>false</CODE>.  We proceed as if we had loaded the appropriate
files and started a top-level with <CODE>Twelf.top ();</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
?- append (cons true nil) (cons false nil) L.
</PRE>

<P>
Here, <CODE>L</CODE> is a free existential variable.  We search for an object
<CODE>M : append (cons true nil) (cons false nil) L</CODE>, even though
this object will not be shown in this form or query.  Each
constant declaration in the signature is tried in turn, unifying
the head with the goal above.  In this manner, we obtain the
following sequence of goals and actions.  Note that the intermediate
forms and comments are not printed when this is run.  They are added
here to illustrate the behavior.

</P>

<PRE>
% original goal after parsing and type reconstruction
?- append (cons true nil) (cons false nil) L.
[try appNil:
     append nil K1 K1
   = append (cons true nil) (cons false nil) L
 unification fails with constant clash: nil &#60;&#62; cons
]
[try appCons:
     append (cons X1 L1) K2 (cons X1 M1)
   = append (cons true nil) (cons false nil) L
 unification succeeds with
 X1 = true, L1 = nil, K2 = cons false nil, L = cons true M1
]
% subgoal
?- append nil (cons false nil) M1.
[try appNil:
     append nil K3 K3
   = append nil (cons false nil) M1
 unification and subgoal succeeds with
 K3 = cons false nil, M1 = cons false nil
]
</PRE>

<P>
At this point the overall goal succeeds and we read off the
answer substitution for the only free variable in the query,
namely <CODE>L</CODE>.  It was first determined to be <CODE>cons true M1</CODE>
and then <CODE>M1</CODE> was instantiated to <CODE>cons false nil</CODE>,
leading to the instantiation

</P>

<PRE>
L = cons true (cons false nil).
</PRE>

<P>
If instead we pose the query

</P>

<PRE>
?- X : append (cons true nil) (cons false nil) L.
</PRE>

<P>
we also obtain the proof term

</P>

<PRE>
L = cons true (cons false nil);
X = appCons appNil.
</PRE>

<P>
As another example we consider a query with several solutions which are
enumerated when we ask for further results.  This time we do not trace
the steps of the execution, but show the interaction verbatim.

</P>

<PRE>
?- append L K (cons true (cons false nil)).
Solving...
K = cons true (cons false nil);
L = nil.
More? <KBD>y</KBD>
K = cons false nil;
L = cons true nil.
More? <KBD>y</KBD>
K = nil;
L = cons true (cons false nil).
More? <KBD>y</KBD>
No more solutions
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC26">5.5  Operational Semantics</A></H2>

</P>
<P>
The operational semantics of Twelf is a form of typed constraint logic
programming.  We will use standard terminology from this area.  A type
family which is used in a program or goal is called a <EM>predicate</EM>.
A constant declaration in a signature which is available during search
is called a <EM>clause</EM>.  A clause typically has the form <CODE>c : a
M1 ... Mm &#60;- A1 &#60;- ... &#60;- An</CODE>, where <CODE>a M1 ... Mm</CODE> is
the <EM>head of the clause</EM> and <CODE>A1</CODE> through <CODE>An</CODE> are the
<EM>subgoals</EM>.  A clause is used to reduce a goal to subgoals by a
process called <EM>backchaining</EM>.  Backchaining unifies the head of
the clause with the current goal to generate <EM>subgoals</EM>.  Next, we
<EM>select</EM> one of the subgoals as a current goal and continue the
search process.  Actually, instead of unification (which is undecidable
in LF), Twelf employs <EM>constraint simplification</EM> and carries along
equational constraints in a normal form.

</P>
<P>
A hypothesis which is introduced during search is a <EM>local
assumption</EM>; a parameter is a <EM>local parameter</EM>.  Parameters act
like constants in unification, except that their occurrences might be
restricted due to <EM>parameter dependency</EM>.

</P>
<P>
Without going into a formal description, here are the central ideas of
the operational semantics.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Clause selection.
<DD>
 The clauses are tried in the following order: from most recent to least
recent local assumption, then from first to last clause in the global
signature.

<DT>Subgoal selection.
<DD>
 Subgoals are solved from the inside out.  For example, when a clause
<CODE>c : A &#60;- B &#60;- C.</CODE>  is applied to solve the goal <CODE>?- A.</CODE> then the
first subgoal is <CODE>B</CODE> and the second subgoal <CODE>C</CODE>.  Truly
dependent variables will only be subject to unification and never
give rise to a subgoal.  For example <CODE>c : {X:b} a X &#60;- a c</CODE> is
a clause with head <CODE>a X</CODE>, subgoal <CODE>a c</CODE>, and existential variable
<CODE>X</CODE>.

<DT>Unification.
<DD>
 An atomic goal is unified with the clause head using higher-order
pattern unification.  All equations outside this fragment are postponed
and carried along as constraints.

<DT>Local assumptions.
<DD>
 A goal of the form <CODE>?- A -&#62; B.</CODE> introduces a local assumption <CODE>A</CODE>
and then solves <CODE>B</CODE> under this assumption.  To solve atomic goals,
local assumptions are tried before global clauses, using the most
recently made assumption first.  Note that this is different from
Prolog <CODE>assert</CODE> in that <CODE>A</CODE> is available only for solving
<CODE>B</CODE>.

<DT>Local parameters.
<DD>
 Parameters are introduced into proof search by goals of the form
<CODE>?- {x:A} B.</CODE> which generates a <EM>new</EM> parameter <CODE>a</CODE> and
then solves the result of substituting <CODE>a</CODE> for <CODE>x</CODE> in
<CODE>B</CODE>.  Parameters are also called <EM>universal variables</EM> since
they are not subject to instantiation during unification.  Local
parameters will never be used as local assumptions during search.

<P>
As an example, we consider simple type inference for the pure
lambda-calculus.  An extension of this example to Mini-ML is given in
the course notes <CITE>Pfenning 1992, Computation and Deduction</CITE>.  The
code below can be found in the file <TT>`examples/guide/lam.elf'</TT>.

</P>

<PRE>
% Simple types
tp : type.                              %name tp T.

arrow : tp -&#62; tp -&#62; tp.                 % T1 =&#62; T2

% Expressions
exp : type.                             %name exp E.

lam   : (exp -&#62; exp) -&#62; exp.            % lam x. E
app   : exp -&#62; exp -&#62; exp.              % (E1 E2)

% Type inference 
% |- E : T  (expression E has type T)

of : exp -&#62; tp -&#62; type.                 %name of P.

tp_lam : of (lam E) (arrow T1 T2)       % |- lam x. E : T1 =&#62; T2
          &#60;- ({x:exp}                   % if  x:T1 |- E : T2.
                of x T1 -&#62; of (E x) T2).

tp_app : of (app E1 E2) T1              % |- E1 E2 : T1
          &#60;- of E1 (arrow T2 T1)        % if  |- E1 : T2 =&#62; T1
          &#60;- of E2 T2.                  % and |- E2 : T2.
</PRE>

<P>
Again, we have used the notation <CODE>A &#60;- B</CODE> to emphasize
the interpretation of constant declarations as clauses.  We now
trace the query which infers the most general type of the identity
function, represented as <CODE>lam [x:exp] x</CODE>.  We indicate the scope
of hypotheses which are introduced during search by indentation.

</P>

<PRE>
% original query, <CODE>T</CODE> free
?- of (lam [x:exp] x) T.
% use <CODE>tp_lam</CODE> with <CODE>E = ([x:exp] x)</CODE> and <CODE>T = arrow T1 T2</CODE>
% subgoal
?- {x:exp} of x T1 -&#62; of x T2.
% introduce parameter <CODE>e</CODE>
?- of e T1 -&#62; of e T2.
% introduce hypothesis labelled <CODE>p</CODE>
p:of e T1
 ?- of e T2.
 % succeed by hypothesis <CODE>p</CODE> with <CODE>T1 = T2</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
At this point the query succeeds and prints the answer substitution.

</P>

<PRE>
T = arrow T1 T1.
More? <KBD>y</KBD>
No more solutions
</PRE>

<P>
We requested more solution by typing <KBD>y</KBD>, but there are no further
possibilities.  The free variable <CODE>T1</CODE> in the answer substitution
means that every instance of <CODE>arrow T1 T1</CODE> provides a solution to
the original query.  In other words, <CODE>lam [x:exp] x</CODE> has type
<CODE>arrow T1 T1</CODE> for all types <CODE>T1</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
As a second example we verify that self-application is not well-typed in
the simply-typed lambda-calculus.

</P>

<PRE>
?- of (lam [x:exp] app x x) T.
% use <CODE>tp_lam</CODE> with <CODE>T = arrow T1 T2</CODE>
% subgoal
?- {x:exp} of x T1 -&#62; of (app x x) T2.
% introduce parameter <CODE>e</CODE>
?- of e T1 -&#62; of (app e e) T2.
% introduce hypothesis <CODE>p:of a T1</CODE>
p:of e T1
 ?- of (app e e) T2.
 % use <CODE>tp_app</CODE>
 % first subgoal
 ?- of e (arrow T3 T2).
 % succeed by hypothesis <CODE>p</CODE> with <CODE>T1 = arrow T3 T2</CODE>
 % second subgoal
 ?- of e T3.
 % fail, since <CODE>T3 = arrow T3 T2</CODE> has no solution
</PRE>

<P>
At the point where the second subgoals fails we backtrack.  However, all
other alternatives fail immediately, since the clause head does not
unify with the goal and the overall query fails.
