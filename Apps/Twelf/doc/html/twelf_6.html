<P>
In most cases, the correctness of the algorithmic interpretation of a
signature as a logic program depends on a restriction to queries of a
certain form.  Often, this is a restriction of some arguments to
<EM>inputs</EM> which must be given as <EM>ground</EM> objects, that is,
objects not containing any existential variables.  In return, one often
obtains <EM>outputs</EM> which will also be ground.  In the logic
programming terminology, the information about which arguments to a
predicate should be considered input and output is
called <EM>mode information</EM>.

</P>
<P>
Twelf supports a simple system of modes.  It checks explicit mode
declarations by the programmer against the signature and signals errors
if the prescribed information flow is violated.  Currently, queries are
not checked against the mode declaration.

</P>
<P>
Mode checking is useful to uncover certain types of errors which
elude the type-checker.  It can also be used to generate more efficient
code, although the compiler currently does not take advantage
of mode information.

</P>
<P>
There are two forms of mode declarations: a short form which is adequate
and appropriate most of the time, and a long form which is sometimes
necessary to ascribe the right modes to implicit arguments

</P>

<PRE>
mdecl ::= smdecl    % short mode declaration
        | fmdecl    % full mode declaration

decl ::= ...
       | %mode mdecl.

</P>
<P>
There are two forms of mode declarations: a short and a full form.
The short form is an abbreviation which is expanded into the full
form when it is unambiguous.

</P>

<PRE>
mode ::= +       % input
       | *       % unrestricted
       | -       % output

mid ::= mode id  % named mode identifier, one token

smdecl ::= id          % type family <EM>a</EM>
         | smdecl mid  % argument mode
</PRE>

<P>
Mode declarations for a predicate <CODE>a</CODE> must come before any clauses
defining <CODE>a</CODE>.  Note that the mode followed with the identifier must
be one token, such as <SAMP>`+L'</SAMP> and not <SAMP>`+ L'</SAMP>.  The short form is
most convenient in typical situations.  For example, we can declare that
the <CODE>append</CODE> program (see section <A HREF="twelf_5.html#SEC25">5.4  Sample Trace</A>) takes the first two
arguments as input and produces the the third as output.

</P>

<PRE>
append  : list -&#62; list -&#62; list -&#62; type.
%mode append +L +K -M.
</PRE>

<P>
If we wanted to use <CODE>append</CODE> to split a list into two
sublists, we would instead declare

</P>

<PRE>
append : list -&#62; list -&#62; list -&#62; type.
%mode append -L -K +M.
</PRE>

<P>
where the clauses <CODE>appNil</CODE> and <CODE>appCons</CODE> remain
unchanged.

</P>
<P>
In the lambda-calculus type checker (see section <A HREF="twelf_5.html#SEC27">5.6  Sample Program</A>), the type
must be an unrestricted argument.

</P>

<PRE>
of : exp -&#62; tp -&#62; type.
%mode of +E *T.
</PRE>

<P>
If we declare it as an input argument, <CODE>%mode of +E +T</CODE>,
we obtain an error pointing to the first occurrence of <CODE>T2</CODE>
in the clause <CODE>tp_app</CODE> reproduced below.

</P>

<PRE>
examples/nd/lam.elf:27.20-27.22 Error: 
Occurrence of variable T2 in input (+) argument not necessarily ground

tp_app : of (app E1 E2) T1
          &#60;- of E1 (arrow T2 T1)
          &#60;- of E2 T2.
</PRE>

<P>
If we declare it as an output argument, <CODE>%mode of +E -T</CODE>,
we obtain an error pointing to the second occurrence of <CODE>T1</CODE>
in the clause <CODE>tp_lam</CODE> reproduced below.

</P>

<PRE>
examples/nd/lam.elf:25.8-25.10 Error: 
Occurrence of variable T1 in output (-) argument not necessarily ground

tp_lam : of (lam E) (arrow T1 T2)
          &#60;- ({x:exp}
                of x T1 -&#62; of (E x) T2).
</PRE>

<P>
In general, for a mode declaration in short form the arguments are
specified exactly as they would look in the program.  This means one
cannot specify the modes of implicit arguments which are filled in by
term reconstruction.  These modes are reconstructed as follows: each
implicit argument which appears in the type of an input argument is
considered input <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>, those among the remaining which appear in an
output argument are considered output <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, the rest are
unrestricted.  The mode declaration is echoed in full form, so the user
can verify the correctness of the modes assigned to implicit arguments.
If the inferred full mode declaration is incorrect, or if one wants to
be explicit about modes, one should use full mode declarations
(see section <A HREF="twelf_6.html#SEC30">6.2  Full Mode Declaration</A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC30">6.2  Full Mode Declaration</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>

</P>
<P>
To specify modes for implicit arguments one must use the full form of
mode declaration.  A <CODE>mode</CODE> can be one of <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="twelf_6.html#SEC29">6.1  Short Mode Declaration</A>).

</P>

<PRE>
fmdecl ::= mode {id : term} fmdecl
         | mode {id} fmdecl
         | term
</PRE>

<P>
The term following the mode prefix in a full mode declaration must
always have the form <CODE><EM>a</EM> <EM>x1</EM> ... <EM>xn</EM></CODE> where
<EM>x1</EM> through <EM>xn</EM> are variables declared in the mode prefix.
As an example, we give an alternative specification of the <CODE>append</CODE>
predicate.

</P>

<PRE>
append : list -&#62; list -&#62; list -&#62; type.
%mode +{L:list} +{K:list} -{M:list} append L K M.
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC31">6.3  Mode Checking</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>

</P>
<P>
Mode checking for input, output, and unrestricted arguments examines
each clause as it is encountered.  The algorithm performs a kind of
abstract interpretation of the clause, keeping track of a list of the
existential variables for which it knows that they will be ground.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>We assume each existential variable with a strict occurrence

(see section <A HREF="twelf_4.html#SEC17">4.3  Strict Occurrences</A>) in an input argument to the clause head to
be ground.

<LI>We traverse the subgoals in evaluation order (see section <A HREF="twelf_5.html#SEC26">5.5  Operational Semantics</A>).  For each subgoal we first verify that all input arguments
will be ground, using the information about the existential variables
collected so far.  If this check succeeds we add all variables which
have a strict occurrence in an output argument of the subgoal to the
list of variables with known ground instantiations.

<LI>After the last subgoal has been examined, we verify that the

output arguments in the clause head are now also ground.
</OL>

<P>
Arguments whose mode is unrestricted are ignored: they do no need to be
checked, and they do not contribute any information about the
instantiations of existential variables.
