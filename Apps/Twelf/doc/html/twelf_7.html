<P>
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>

</P>
<P>
Besides checking types and modes, Twelf can also verify if a given type
family, when interpreted as a logic program, always terminates on
well-moded goals.  In many cases this means that the program implements
a decision procedure.  Of course, in general termination is undecidable,
so we only check a simple sufficient condition.

</P>
<P>
Checking termination presupposes that the program is well-typed and
guarantees termination only when the arguments involved in the
termination order are ground.  This will always be true for well-moded
goals, since mode and termination declarations must be consistent.

</P>
<P>
Termination is different from checking types and modes in that it is not
checked incrementally as the signature is read.  Instead, termination of
a predicate is a global property of the program once it has been read.
Thus termination declarations came after the predicate has been fully
defined; further extensions of the predicate are not checked and may
invalidate termination.

</P>
<P>
The termination checker is rather rudimentary in that it only allows
lexicographic and simultaneous extensions of the subterm ordering.
Moreover, it does not take into account if a result returned by a
predicate is smaller than an input argument.  Nonetheless, for the style
of programs written in Twelf, the termination of many decision
procedures can be verified.

<P>
The termination orders we construct are lexicographic or simultaneous
extensions of the subterm ordering explained in section <A HREF="twelf_7.html#SEC34">7.2  Subterm Ordering</A>.
The termination declaration associates the termination order with
argument positions of predicates via call patterns.

</P>
<P>
The case of mutually recursive predicates is particularly complex
and requires mutual call patterns and mutual arguments.
Their syntax is given below; they are explained in section <A HREF="twelf_7.html#SEC37">7.5  Mutual Recursion</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
args ::=
       | id args       % named argument
       | _ args        % anonymous argument

callpat ::= id args    % <EM>a</EM> <EM>x1</EM> ... <EM>xn</EM>

callpats ::= 
           | (callpat) callpats
                       % mutual call patterns

ids ::=
      | id ids         % argument name

marg ::= id            % single argument
       | ( ids )       % mutual arguments

orders ::=
         | order orders % component order

order ::= marg         % subterm order
        | { orders }   % lexicographic order
        | [ orders ]   % simultaneous order

tdecl ::= order callpats    % termination declaration

decl ::= ...
       | %terminates tdecl. % termination declaration
</PRE>

<P>
All identifiers in the order specification of a termination declaration
must be upper case, must occur in the call patterns, and no variable may
be repeated.  Furthermore, all arguments participating in the
termination order must occur in the call patterns in input positions.

</P>
<P>
The most frequent form of termination declaration is

</P>

<PRE>
%terminates Xi (a X1 ... Xn).
</PRE>

<P>
which expresses that predicate <CODE>a</CODE> terminates because recursive
calls decrease the input argument <CODE>Xi</CODE> according to the subterm
ordering (see section <A HREF="twelf_7.html#SEC34">7.2  Subterm Ordering</A>).

</P>
<P>
As an example, we consider a proof that simple type inference
(see section <A HREF="twelf_5.html#SEC27">5.6  Sample Program</A>) terminates.  Recall the relevant program
fragment (see <TT>`examples/guide/lam.elf'</TT>).

</P>

<PRE>
of : exp -&#62; tp -&#62; type.                 %name of P.
%mode of +E *T.

tp_lam : of (lam E) (arrow T1 T2)       % |- lam x. E : T1 =&#62; T2
          &#60;- ({x:exp}                   % if  x:T1 |- E : T2.
                of x T1 -&#62; of (E x) T2).

tp_app : of (app E1 E2) T1              % |- E1 E2 : T1
          &#60;- of E1 (arrow T2 T1)        % if  |- E1 : T2 =&#62; T1
          &#60;- of E2 T2.                  % and |- E2 : T2.
</PRE>

<P>
The typability of an expression is always reduced to the typability of
its subexpressions.  Therefore any call to the <CODE>of</CODE> predicate with
a ground expression should terminate.  In general, termination can only
be checked for input arguments, and all calls must be well-moded
(see section <A HREF="twelf_6.html#SEC31">6.3  Mode Checking</A>).  Twelf verifies termination with the
declaration

</P>

<PRE>
%terminates E (of E T).
</PRE>

<P>
Here, <CODE>E</CODE> specifies the decreasing argument, namely the first
argument of the typing judgment as expressed in the call pattern
<CODE>(of E T)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
A corresponding attempt to show that evaluation always terminates,

</P>

<PRE>
%terminates E (eval E V).
</PRE>

<P>
fails for the clause <CODE>ev_app</CODE> with the message

</P>

<PRE>
examples/guide/lam.elf:1053-1068 Error:
Termination violation:
(E1' V2) &#60; (app E1 E2)
</PRE>

<P>
indicating that in a recursive call the term <CODE>E1' V2</CODE> could not be
shown to be smaller than <CODE>app E1 E2</CODE>.  In our example, of course,
evaluation need not terminate for precisely this reason.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC34">7.2  Subterm Ordering</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>

</P>
<P>
On first-order terms, that is, terms not containing lambda-abstraction,
the subterm ordering is familiar: <EM>M &#60; N</EM> if <EM>M</EM> is a strict
subterm of <EM>N</EM>, that is, <EM>M</EM> is a subterm <EM>N</EM> and
<EM>M</EM> is different from <EM>N</EM>.

</P>
<P>
On higher-order terms, the relation is slightly more complicated because
we must allow the substitution of parameters for bound variables without
destroying the subterm relation.  Consider, for example, the case of the
typing rule

</P>

<PRE>
of : exp -&#62; tp -&#62; type.                 %name of P.
%mode of +E *T.

tp_lam : of (lam E) (arrow T1 T2)       % |- lam x. E : T1 =&#62; T2
          &#60;- ({x:exp}                   % if  x:T1 |- E : T2.
                of x T1 -&#62; of (E x) T2).
</PRE>

<P>
from the signature for type inference (see section <A HREF="twelf_5.html#SEC27">5.6  Sample Program</A>) in the
file <TT>`example/guide/lam.elf'</TT>.  We must recognize that

</P>

<PRE>
(E x) &#60; (lam E)
</PRE>

<P>
according to the subterm ordering.  This is because <CODE>E</CODE> stands for
a term <CODE>[y:exp] E'</CODE> and so <CODE>E x</CODE> has the same structure as
<CODE>E'</CODE> except that <CODE>y</CODE> (a bound variable) has been replaced by
<CODE>x</CODE> (a parameter).  This kind of pattern arises frequently in
Twelf programs.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the restriction to parameter arguments of functions
is critical.  For example, the lax rule

</P>

<PRE>
tp_applam : of (app (lam E1) E2) T2
             &#60;- of (E1 E2) T2.
</PRE>

<P>
which applies <CODE>E1</CODE> to <CODE>E2</CODE> which is not a parameter, is indeed
not terminating.  This can be seen from the query

</P>

<PRE>
?- of (app (lam [x:exp] app x x) (lam [y:exp] app y y)) T.
</PRE>

<P>
The restriction of the arguments to parameters can be lifted when the
type of the argument is not mutually recursive with the result type of
the function.  For example, the signature for natural deduction
(see section <A HREF="twelf_3.html#SEC13">3.6  Sample Signature</A>, contains no constructor which allows
propositions to occur inside individual terms.  Therefore

</P>

<PRE>
(A T) &#60; (forall A)
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>A : i -&#62; o</CODE> and <CODE>T : i</CODE> is an arbitrary term (not just
a parameter).  Intuitively, this is correct because the number of
quantifiers and logical connectives is smaller on the left, since
<CODE>T</CODE> cannot contain such quantifiers or connectives.

</P>
<P>
This kind of precise analysis is important, for example, in the proof
of cut elimination or the termination of polymorphic type
reconstruction.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC35">7.3  Lexicographic Orders</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>

</P>
<P>
Lexicographic orders are specified as

</P>

<PRE>
{<VAR>O1</VAR> ... <VAR>On</VAR>}
</PRE>

<P>
Using <EM>vi</EM> and <EM>wi</EM> for corresponding argument structures
whose order is already defined, we compare them lexicographically as
follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>{v1</EM> ... <EM>vn}</EM> <EM>&#60;</EM> <EM>{w1</EM> ... <EM>wn}</EM>, if
<DD>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>v1 &#60; w1</EM>, or
<DD>
<DT><EM>v1 = w1</EM> and <EM>v2 &#60; w2</EM>, or
<DD>
<DT>...
<DD>
<DT><EM>v1 = w1</EM>, <EM>v2 = w2</EM>, ..., and <EM>vn &#60; wn</EM>.
<DD>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
A lexicographic order is needed, for example, to show termination of
Ackermann's function, defined in <TT>`examples/arith/arith.elf'</TT> with
the termination declaration in <BR><TT>`examples/arith/arith.thm'</TT>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC36">7.4  Simultaneous Orders</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>

</P>
<P>
Simultaneous orders require that one of its elements decreases while all
others remain the same.  This is strictly weaker than a lexicographic
ordering built from the same components.  Technically speaking it is
therefore is redundant for termination checking, since the corresponding
lexicographic ordering could be used instead.  However, for inductive
theorem proving it is quite useful, since the search space for
simultaneous induction is much smaller than for lexicographic induction.

</P>
<P>
Simultaneous orders are specified as

</P>

<PRE>
[<VAR>O1</VAR> ... <VAR>On</VAR>]
</PRE>

<P>
Using <EM>vi</EM> and <EM>wi</EM> for corresponding argument structures
whose order is already defined, we compare them simultaneously as
follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>[v1</EM> ... <EM>vn]</EM> <EM>&#60;</EM> <EM>[w1</EM> ... <EM>wn]</EM>, if
<DD>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>v1 &#60; w1</EM>, <EM>v2 &#60;= w2</EM>, ..., and <EM>vn &#60;= wn</EM>, or
<DD>
<DT><EM>v1 &#60;= w1</EM>, <EM>v2 &#60; w2</EM>, ..., and <EM>vn &#60;= wn</EM>, or
<DD>
<DT>...
<DD>
<DT><EM>v1 &#60;= w1</EM>, <EM>v2 &#60;= w2</EM>, ..., and <EM>vn &#60; wn</EM>.
<DD>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
A combination of simultaneous and lexicographic order is used, for
example, in the admissibility of cut found in
<TT>`examples/cut-elim/int.thm'</TT>, where either the cut formula <EM>A</EM>
gets smaller, or if <EM>A</EM> stays the same, either the derivation of
the left or right premise get smaller while the other stays the same.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC37">7.5  Mutual Recursion</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>

</P>
<P>
Mutually recursive predicates present a challenge to termination
checking, since decreasing arguments might appear in different
positions.  Moreover, mutually recursive predicates <CODE>a</CODE> and
<CODE>a'</CODE> might be prioritized so that when <CODE>a</CODE> calls <CODE>a'</CODE> all
termination arguments remain the same, but when <CODE>a'</CODE> calls <CODE>a</CODE>
the arguments are smaller according to the termination order.

</P>
<P>
To handle the association of related argument in mutually recursive
predicates, so-called <EM>mutual arguments</EM> can be specified
in a termination order.  They are given as

</P>

<PRE>
(X1 ... Xn)
</PRE>

<P>
The priority between predicates is indicated by the order of the
call patterns.  If we analyze call patterns

</P>

<PRE>
(a1 args1)
(a2 args2)
...
(an argsn)
</PRE>

<P>
then <CODE>ai</CODE> may call <CODE>aj</CODE> for <EM>i &#60; j</EM> with equal
termination arguments, but calls of <CODE>ai</CODE> from <CODE>aj</CODE>
must decrease the termination order.

</P>
<P>
Mutual arguments are used, for example, in the proofs of soundness (file
<BR><TT>`examples/lp-horn/uni-sound.thm'</TT>) and completeness (file
<BR><TT>`examples/lp-horn/uni-complete.thm'</TT>) of uniform derivations for
Horn logic.
