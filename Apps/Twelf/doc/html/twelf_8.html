<STRONG>Disclaimer:</STRONG> The theorem proving component of Twelf is in an
even more experimental stage and currently under active development.
There are two main restrictions which limit its utility:
(1) it only support reasoning about closed objects, and (2)
it cannot apply lemmas automatically.

</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it can prove a number of interesting examples automatically
which illustrate our approach the meta-theorem proving which is
described in <CITE>Schuermann and Pfenning 1998, CADE</CITE>.  These examples
include type preservation for Mini-ML, one direction of compiler
correctness for different abstract machines, soundness and completeness
for logic programming interpreters, and the deduction theorem for
Hilbert's formulation of propositional logic.  These and other examples
can be found in the example directories of the Twelf distribution
(see section <A HREF="twelf_13.html#SEC68">13  Examples</A>).

</P>
<P>
A <EM>theorem</EM> in Twelf is, properly speaking, a meta-theorem: it
expresses a property of objects constructed over a fixed LF signature.
Theorems are stated in the meta-logic M2 whose quantifiers range over LF
objects.  In the simplest case, we may just be asserting the existence
of an LF object of a given type.  This only requires direct search for a
proof term, using methods inspired by logic programming.  More
generally, we may claim and prove forall/exists statements which allow
us to express meta-theorems which require structural induction, such as
type preservation under evaluation in a simple functional language
(see section <A HREF="twelf_5.html#SEC27">5.6  Sample Program</A>).

There are two forms of declarations related to the proving of theorems
and meta-theorems.  The first, <CODE>%theorem</CODE>, states a theorem as a
meta-formula (<CODE>mform</CODE>) in the meta-logic M2 defined below.  The
second, <CODE>%prove</CODE>, gives a resource bound, a theorem, and an
induction ordering and asks Twelf to search for a proof.

</P>
<P>
Note that a well-typed <CODE>%theorem</CODE> declaration always succeeds,
while the <CODE>%prove</CODE> declaration only succeeds if Twelf can find a
proof.

</P>

<P>
The prover only accepts quantifier alternations of the form
<CODE>forall* <VAR>decs</VAR> forall <VAR>decs</VAR> exists <VAR>decs</VAR> true</CODE>.
Note that the implicit quantifiers (which will be suppressed when
printing the proof terms) must all be collected in front.

</P>
<P>
The syntax and meaning of <CODE>order</CODE> and <CODE>callpats</CODE> are explained
in section <A HREF="twelf_7.html#SEC32">7  Termination</A>, since they are also critical notions in the
simpler termination checker.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC40">8.2  Sample Theorems</A></H2>

<P>
As a first example, we use the theorem prover to establish a simple
theorem in first-order logic (namely that <EM>A</EM> implies <EM>A</EM> for
any proposition <EM>A</EM>), using the signature for natural deduction
(see section <A HREF="twelf_3.html#SEC13">3.6  Sample Signature</A>).

</P>

<PRE>
%theorem
trivI : exists {D:{A:o} nd (A imp A)}
        true.

%prove 2 {} (trivI D).
</PRE>

<P>
The empty termination ordering <CODE>{}</CODE> instructs Twelf not to use
induction to prove the theorem.  The declarations above succeed, and
with the default setting of <CODE>3</CODE> for <CODE>Twelf.chatter</CODE> we see

</P>

<PRE>
%theorem trivI : ({A:o} nd (A imp A)) -&#62; type.
%prove 2 {} (trivI D).
%mode -{D:{A:o} nd (A imp A)} trivI D.
% ------------------
/trivI/:  trivI ([A:o] impi ([D1:nd A] D1)).
% ------------------
</PRE>

<P>
The line starting with <CODE>%theorem</CODE> shows the way the theorem will be
realized as a logic program predicate, the line starting with
<CODE>/trivI/</CODE> gives the implementation, which, in this case, consists
of just one line.

</P>
<P>
The second example is the type preservation theorem for evaluation in
the lambda-calculus.  This is a continuation of the example in Section
section <A HREF="twelf_5.html#SEC27">5.6  Sample Program</A> in the file <TT>`examples/guide/lam.elf'</TT>.
Type preservation states that if and expression <CODE>E</CODE> has type
<CODE>T</CODE> and <CODE>E</CODE> evaluates to <CODE>V</CODE>, the <CODE>V</CODE> also has
type <CODE>T</CODE>.  This is expressed as the following <CODE>%theorem</CODE>
declaration.

</P>

<PRE>
%theorem
tps : forall* {E:exp} {V:exp} {T:tp}
       forall {D:eval E V} {P:of E T}
       exists {Q:of V T}
       true.
</PRE>

<P>
The proof proceeds by structural induction on <CODE>D</CODE>, the evaluation
from <CODE>E</CODE> to <CODE>V</CODE>.  Therefore we can search for the proof with
the following declaration (where the size bound of <CODE>5</CODE> on proof
term size is somewhat arbitrary).

</P>

<PRE>
%prove 5 D (tps D P Q).
</PRE>

<P>
Twelf finds and displays the proof easily.  The resulting program is
installed in the global signature and can then be used to apply type
preservation (see section <A HREF="twelf_8.html#SEC43">8.5  Proof Realizations</A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC41">8.3  Proof Steps</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
<A NAME="IDX110"></A>

</P>
<P>
We expect the proof search component of Twelf to undergo major changes
in the near future, so we only briefly review the current state.

</P>
<P>
Proving proceeds using three main kinds of steps:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Filling
<DD>
 Using iterative deepening, Twelf searches directly for objects to fill
the existential quantifiers, given all the constants in the signature
and the universally quantified variables in the theorem.  The number of
constructors in the answer substitution for each existential quantifier
is bounded by the size which is given as part of the <CODE>%prove</CODE>
declaration, thus guaranteeing termination (in principle).

<DT>Recursion
<DD>
 Based on the termination ordering, Twelf appeals to the induction
hypothesis on smaller arguments.  If there are several ways to use the
induction hypothesis, Twelf non-deterministically picks one which has
not yet been used.  Since there may be infinitely many different ways to
apply the induction hypothesis, the parameter
<CODE>Twelf.Prover.maxRecurse</CODE> bounds the number of recursion steps in
each case of the proof.

<DT>Splitting
<DD>
 Based on the types of the universally quantified variables, Twelf
distinguishes all possible cases by considering all constructors in
the signatures.  It nevers splits a variable which appears as an
index in an input argument, and if there are several possibilities
it picks the one with fewest resulting cases.  Splitting can go on
indefinitely, so the paramater <CODE>Twelf.Prover.maxSplit</CODE> bounds
the number of times a variable may be split.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC42">8.4  Search Strategies</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>

</P>
<P>
The basic proof steps of filling, recursion, and splitting are
sequentialized in a simple strategy which never backtracks.  First we
attempt to fill all existential variables simultaneously.  If that fails
we recurse by trying to find new ways to appeal to the induction
hypothesis.  If this is not possible, we pick a variable to distinguish
cases and then prove each subgoal in turn.  If none of the steps
are possible we fail.

</P>
<P>
This behavior can be changed with the parameter
<CODE>Twelf.Prover.strategy</CODE> which defaults to <CODE>Twelf.Prover.FRS</CODE>
(which means Filling-Recursion-Splitting).  When set to
<CODE>Twelf.Prover.RFS</CODE> Twelf will first try recursion, then filling,
followed by splitting.  This is often faster, but fails in some cases
where the default strategy succeeds.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>

</P>
<P>
Proofs of meta-theorems are realized as logic programs.  Such a logic
program is a relational representation of the constructive proof and can
be executed to generate witness terms for the existentials from given
instances of the universal quantifiers.  As an example, we consider
once more type preservation (see section <A HREF="twelf_8.html#SEC40">8.2  Sample Theorems</A>).

</P>
<P>
After the declarations,

</P>

       forall {D:eval E V} {P:of E T}

       true.

which is the proof of type preservation expressed as a logic program
with two clauses: one for evaluation of a lambda-abstraction, and one
for application.  Using the <CODE>%solve</CODE> declaration (see section <A HREF="twelf_5.html#SEC23">5.2  Solve Declaration</A>) we can, for example, evaluate and type-check the identity
applied to itself and then use type preservation to obtain a typing
derivation for the resulting value.

Recall that <CODE>%solve c : V</CODE> executes the query <CODE>V</CODE> and defines
the constant <CODE>c</CODE> to abbreviate the resulting proof term.
