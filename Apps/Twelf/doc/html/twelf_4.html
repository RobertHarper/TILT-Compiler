Representations of deductions in LF typically contain a lot of redundant
information.  In order to make LF practical, Twelf gives the user the
opportunity to omit redundant information in declarations and
reconstructs it from context.  Unlike for functional languages, this
requires recovering objects as well as types, so we refer to this phase
as term reconstruction.

</P>
<P>
There are criteria which guarantee that the term reconstruction problem
is decidable, but unfortunately these criteria are either very
complicated or still force much redundant information to be supplied.
Therefore, the Twelf implementation employs a reconstruction algorithm
which always terminates and gives one of three answers:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>yes, and here is the most general reconstruction;

<LI>no, and here is the problem; or

<LI>maybe.

</OL>

<P>
The last characterizes the situations where there is insufficient
information to guarantee a most general solution to the term reconstruction
problem.  Because of the decidable nature of type-checking in LF, the user
can always annotate the term further until it falls into one of the
definitive categories.

The model of term reconstruction employed by Twelf is
straightforward, although it employs a relatively complex algorithm.
The basic principle is a duality between quantifiers omitted in a
constant declaration and implicit arguments where the constant is used.
Recall some definitions in the signature defining natural deductions
(see section <A HREF="twelf_3.html#SEC13">3.6  Sample Signature</A>).

</P>

<PRE>
o : type.
and : o -&#62; o -&#62; o.   %infix right 10 and
nd : o -&#62; type.
andi : nd A -&#62; nd B -&#62; nd (A and B).
</PRE>

<P>
The last declaration contains <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE> as free variables.
Type reconstruction infers most general types for the free variables in
a constant declaration and adds implicit quantifiers.  In the example
above, <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE> must both be of type <CODE>o</CODE>.  The
internal form of the constant thus has one of the following two forms.

</P>

<PRE>
andi : {A:o} {B:o} nd A -&#62; nd B -&#62; nd (A and B).
andi : {B:o} {A:o} nd A -&#62; nd B -&#62; nd (A and B).
</PRE>

<P>
These forms are printed during type reconstruction, so the user can
examine if the result of reconstruction matches his expectations.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC16">4.2  Implicit Arguments</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>

</P>
<P>
The quantifiers on <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE> in the declaration

</P>

<PRE>
andi : nd A -&#62; nd B -&#62; nd (A and B).
</PRE>

<P>
were implicit.  The corresponding arguments to <CODE>andi</CODE> are also
implicit.  In fact, since the order of the reconstructed quantifiers is
arbitrary, we cannot know in which order to supply the arguments, so
they must always be omitted.  Thus a constant with <EM>n</EM> implicit
quantifiers is supplied with <EM>n</EM> implicit arguments whereever it is
seen.  These implicit arguments are existential variables whose value
may be determined from context by unification.

</P>
<P>
For example, using also

</P>

<PRE>
true : o.
truei: nd (true).
</PRE>

<P>
we have

</P>

<PRE>
(andi truei truei) : nd (true and true).
</PRE>

<P>
During parsing, the expression <CODE>(andi truei truei)</CODE> is interpreted
as

</P>

<PRE>
(andi _ _ truei truei)
</PRE>

<P>
where the two underscores stand for the implicit <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE>
arguments to <CODE>andi</CODE>.  They are replaced by existential variables whose
value will be determined during type reconstruction.  We call them
<CODE>A1</CODE> and <CODE>A2</CODE> and reason as follows.

</P>

<PRE>
|- andi : {A:o} {B:o} nd A -&#62; nd B -&#62; nd (A and B)
|- andi A1 : {B:o} nd A1 -&#62; nd B -&#62; nd (A1 and B)
|- andi A1 A2 : nd A1 -&#62; nd A2 -&#62; nd (A1 and A2)
</PRE>

<P>
At this point, we need a to infer the type of the application
<CODE>(andi A1 A2) truei</CODE>.  This equates the actual type of the argument
with the expected type of the argument.

</P>

<PRE>
|- andi A1 A2 : nd A1 -&#62; nd A2 -&#62; nd (A1 and A2)
|- truei : nd true
------------------------------------------------
|- andi A1 A2 truei : nd A2 -&#62; nd (A1 and A2)
   where nd true = nd A1
</PRE>

<P>
The equation can be solved by instantiating <CODE>A1</CODE> to <CODE>true</CODE> and
we continue:

</P>

<PRE>
|- andi true A2 truei : nd A2 -&#62; nd (true and A2)
|- truei : nd true
------------------------------------------------
|- andi true A2 truei truei : nd (true and A2)
   where nd true = nd A2
|- andi true true truei truei : nd (true and true)
</PRE>

<P>
The last line is the expected result.  In this way, term reconstruction
can always be reduced to solving equations such that every solution to
the set of equations leads to a valid typing and vice versa.

Both for type reconstruction and the operational semantics, Twelf must
solve equations between objects and types.  Unfortunately, it is
undecidable if a set of equations in the LF type theory has a solution.
Worse yet, even if it has solutions, it may not have a most general
solution.  Therefore, Twelf postpones difficult equations as constraints
and solves only those within the pattern fragment (see <CITE>Miller
1991, Journal of Logic and Compuation</CITE> and <CITE>Pfenning 1991, Logical
Frameworks</CITE>).  In this fragment, principal solutions always exist and
can be computed efficiently.  If constraints remain after term
reconstruction, the constant declaration is rejected as ambiguous which
indicates that the user must supply more type information.  We
illustrate this phenomenon and a typical solution in our natural
deduction example.

</P>
<P>
A central concept useful for understanding the finer details of type
reconstruction is the notion of a <EM>strict occurrence</EM> of a free
variable.  We call a position in a term <EM>rigid</EM> if it is not in the
argument of a free variable.  We then call an occurrence of a free
variable <EM>strict</EM> if the occurrence is in a rigid position and all
its arguments (possibly none) are distinct bound variables.

</P>
<P>
If all free variable occurrences in all declarations in a signature are
strict, then term reconstruction will always either fail or succeed with
a principal solution, provided no further terms are omitted (that is,
replaced by an underscore).

</P>
<P>
If a free variable in a declaration of a constant <CODE>c</CODE> has no strict
occurrence at all, then its type can almost never be inferred and most uses of
<CODE>c</CODE> will lead to a constraint.

</P>
<P>
If a free variable has strict and non-strict occurrences then in most
cases term reconstruction will provide a definitive answer, but there is
no guarantee.  Mostly this is because most general answers simply do not
exist, but sometimes because the algorithm generates, but cannot solve
constraints with unique solutions.

</P>
<P>
We use some advanced examples from the natural deduction signature to
illustrate these concepts and ideas.  In the declarations

</P>

<PRE>
foralli : ({x:i} nd (A x)) -&#62; nd (forall A).
foralle : nd (forall A) -&#62; {T:i} nd (A T).
</PRE>

<P>
all free variables have a strict occurrence.  However, if we had
decided to leave <CODE>T</CODE> as an implicit argument,

</P>

<PRE>
foralle : nd (forall A) -&#62; nd (A T).
</PRE>

<P>
then <CODE>T</CODE> has no strict occurrence.  While this declaration is
accepted as unambiguous (with <CODE>A:i -&#62; o</CODE> and <CODE>T:i</CODE>), any
future use of <CODE>foralle</CODE> most likely leads to constraints on
<CODE>T</CODE> which cannot be solved.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC18">4.4  Strict Definitions</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>

</P>
<P>
Definitions are currently restricted so that each argument to the
defined constant, may it be implicit or explicit, must have at least one
strict occurrence in the right-hand side.  For example, the definition
of <CODE>not</CODE> in the signature for natural deduction (see section <A HREF="twelf_3.html#SEC13">3.6  Sample Signature</A>)

</P>

<PRE>
not : o -&#62; o = [A:o] A imp false.
</PRE>

<P>
is strict since the only argument <CODE>A</CODE> has a strict occurrence in
<CODE>A imp false</CODE>.  On the other hand, the definition

</P>

<PRE>
noti : ({p:o} nd A -&#62; nd p) -&#62; nd (not A)
     = [D] impi ([u:nd A] D false u).
</PRE>

<P>
which gives a possible derived introduction rule for negation is not
strict: the argument <CODE>D</CODE> has only one occurrence, and this occurrence
is not strict since the argument <CODE>false</CODE> is not a variable bound in
the body, but a constant.

</P>
<P>
However, the definitions

<PRE>
noti : (nd A -&#62; nd false) -&#62; nd (not A)
     = [D:nd A -&#62; nd false] impi D.
note : nd (not A) -&#62; nd A -&#62; nd false
     = [D:nd (not A)] [E:nd A] impe D E.
</PRE>

<P>
are both strict since arguments <CODE>D</CODE> and <CODE>E</CODE> both have strict
occurrences.  Type-checking these definitions requires that the definition
of <CODE>not A</CODE> is expanded to <CODE>A imp false</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that free variables in the type and the right-hand side of a
definition are shared.  In the above example, <CODE>A</CODE> occurs both in
the types and the right hand side and it should be thought of as the
same <CODE>A</CODE>.  With the implicit quantifiers and abstractions restored,
the definitions above have the following form.

</P>

<PRE>
noti : {A:o} (nd A -&#62; nd false) -&#62; nd (not A)
   = [A:o] [D:nd A -&#62; nd false] impi D.
note : {A:o} nd (not A) -&#62; nd A -&#62; nd false
   = [A:o] [D:nd (not A)] [E:nd A] impe D E.
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC19">4.5  Type Ascription</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>

</P>
<P>
In some circumstances it is useful to directly ascribe a type in order
to disambiguate declarations.  For example, the term <CODE>ori1 truei</CODE>
has principal type <CODE>nd (true or B)</CODE> for a free variable <CODE>B</CODE>.
If we want to constrain this to a derivation of <CODE>nd (true or false)</CODE>
we can write <CODE>ori1 truei : nd (true or false)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Explicit type ascription sometimes helps when the source of a type error
is particularly hard to discern: we can ascribe an expected type to a
subterm, thus verifying our intuition about constituent terms in a
declaration.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="twelf_toc.html#TOC20">4.6  Error Messages</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>

</P>
<P>
When term reconstruction fails, Twelf issues an error message with the
location of the declaration in which the problem occurred and the
disagreement encountered.  A typical message is

</P>

<PRE>
examples/nd/nd.elf:37.35-37.41 Error: Type mismatch
Expected: o
Found:    (i -&#62; o) -&#62; o
Expression clash
</PRE>

<P>
which points to an error in the file <TT>`examples/nd/nd.elf'</TT>, line 37,
characters 35 through 41 where an argument to a function was expected to
have type <CODE>o</CODE>, but was found to have type <CODE>(i -&#62; o) -&#62; o</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If constraints remain, the error location is the whole declaration
with the message

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>filename</VAR>:<VAR>location</VAR> Error: Typing ambiguous -- unresolved constraints
</PRE>

<P>
The <VAR>filename</VAR> and <VAR>location</VAR> information can be used by Emacs
(see section <A HREF="twelf_11.html#SEC53">11  Emacs Interface</A>) to jump to the specified location in the given
file for editing of the incorrect declaration for the constant <CODE>c</CODE>.
The <VAR>location</VAR> has the form
<CODE><VAR>line1</VAR>.<VAR>column1</VAR>-<VAR>line2</VAR>.<VAR>column2</VAR></CODE> and represent
Twelf's best guess as to the source of the error.  Due to the
propagation of non-trivial constraints the source of a type
reconstruction failure can sometimes not be pinpointed very precisely.
