At present, Twelf has been tested in SML of New Jersey (version 110 or
higher) and MLWorks, both of which implement Standard ML (revised 1997)
and the Standard ML Basis Library.  The instructions below apply to
a Unix system.  For instructions for other architectures or updates
please check the file <TT>`INSTALL'</TT> at the Twelf home page and in
the Twelf root directory after unpacking the distribution.

</P>
<P>
On a Unix system you unpack the sources with

</P>

<PRE>
gunzip twelf-1-2.tar.gz
tar -xf twelf-1-2.tar
cd twelf
make
</PRE>

<P>
This builds the Twelf server (see section <A HREF="twelf_10.html#SEC50">10  Twelf Server</A>) for your current
architecture and makes it accessible as <TT>`bin/twelf-server'</TT>.  It
also installs the Twelf Emacs interface (see section <A HREF="twelf_11.html#SEC53">11  Emacs Interface</A>), but
you must add a line

</P>

<PRE>
(load "<VAR>directory</VAR>/emacs/twelf-init.el")
</PRE>

<P>
to your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file, where <VAR>directory</VAR> is the root directory
into which you installed Twelf.  Note that the Twelf installation cannot
be moved after it has been compiled with <CODE>make</CODE>, since absolute
pathnames are built into the executable scripts.

</P>
<P>
Note that the Twelf server presently only works with Standard ML of New
Jersey, since interrupt handling is implementation specific.

</P>
<P>
If you would like to use Twelf as a structure in SML, you can then call

</P>

<PRE>
make twelf-sml
</PRE>

<P>
which creates <TT>`bin/twelf-sml'</TT> for the Twelf-SML mode
(see section <A HREF="twelf_11.html#SEC62">11.9  Twelf-SML Mode</A>).  Calling <CODE>make clean</CODE> will remove
temporary files created by the SML compiler, but not the
executable file.

mlworks-basis  start MLWorks with basis library in Twelf root directory
use "load.sml";  compile and load Twelf
