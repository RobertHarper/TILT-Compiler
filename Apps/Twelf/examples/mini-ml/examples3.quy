% In CONFIG1, tp.elf is loaded staticall.
% T = arrow T1 T1
% is most general (and only) solution

% In CONFIG2, tp.elf is loaded dynamically.
% Consequently, the solutions for T will be
% enumerated in this example.

% In CONFIG3, tpinf.elf is loaded staticall
% Consequently, no Mini-ML type-checking is performed.
