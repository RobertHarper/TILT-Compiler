Changes for compiling with TILT:

Renamed files to end in .sml.

Added (*$import *) directives.

Renamed SS to SS_ in patterns of tptrace.fun.sml and tprecon.fun.sml
to avoid conflict with TILT's bogus toplevel constructor SS.

Eliminated all type abbreviations in signatures.  I thought I was
working around a bug in TILT's signature sharing or ascription code,
but I'm not positive this change matters.
