Comments:

	Does HS permits this code?  Yes.  See the discussion around
	page 7 of the technical report.  It looks like TILT is
	consistent with an earlier version of HS that did not permit
	this code.

	We need to fix the translation of LetExp.  There may be
	similar bugs so we need to look at how the translations of
	local expressions and signature ascription handle escaping
	type information.

Fix:
