Severity:    minor
Problem:

	TILT bombs in reduce_to_remove while compiling ``let datatype
	t = A in A end''

Code:        
Transcript:  
Comments:

	This code does not typecheck under the Definition, HS, or TILT.

	The bug is merely that TILT bombs rather than reject this
	code.

Fix:
	TILT now reports the user error.
