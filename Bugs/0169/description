Title: Word scanning errors in corner cases
Keywords: basis, Word

Severity: library
Problem:

	The word scanning functions (eg, Word.fromString and Word.scan)
	are wrong.  These functions are supposed to match a prefix of the
	input string to a regular expression.  The regular expressions are

		BIN	{ws}(0w)?[0-1]+
		OCT	{ws}(0w)?[0-7]+
		DEC	{ws}(0w)?[0-9]+
		HEX	{ws}(0w?[xX])?[0-9a-fA-F]+

	where {ws} matches optional leading white space.

	TILT's implementation accepts the prefix 0W for any base and the
	prefix 0w for hex.  In particular, the following code should
	terminate and does not because fromString and scan accept the
	wrong regular expressions.

Code:
	val () =
		let
			open StringCvt

			fun testX (name:string, inc : 'word -> LargeWord.word)
					(f:string -> 'word option) (s:string) : unit =
				let	val r =
						(case (Option.map inc (f s)) of
							SOME 0w0 => "OK"
						|	NONE => "WRONG: NONE"
						|	SOME w =>
								"WRONG: SOME " ^ LargeWord.toString w)
				in	print(concat[name," ",s," ",r,"\n"])
				end
			val test8 = testX ("Word8", Word8.toLargeWord)
			val test = testX ("Word", Word.toLargeWord)

			val _ = test Word.fromString "0w20Af"
			val _ = test Word.fromString "0W1"
			val _ = test (scanString (Word.scan DEC)) "0W1"
			val _ = test (scanString (Word.scan OCT)) "0W1"
			val _ = test (scanString (Word.scan HEX)) "0w1"
			val _ = test (scanString (Word.scan HEX)) "0W1"
			val _ = test (scanString (Word.scan BIN)) "0W1"

			val _ = test8 Word8.fromString "0w20Af"
			val _ = test8 Word8.fromString "0W1"
			val _ = test8 (scanString (Word8.scan DEC)) "0W1"
			val _ = test8 (scanString (Word8.scan OCT)) "0W1"
			val _ = test8 (scanString (Word8.scan HEX)) "0w1"
			val _ = test8 (scanString (Word8.scan HEX)) "0W1"
			val _ = test8 (scanString (Word8.scan BIN)) "0W1"
		in	()
		end
