Title: Word scanning errors in corner cases

Problem:

	The word scanning functions (eg, Word.fromString and Word.scan)
	are wrong.  These functions are supposed to match a prefix of the
	input string to a regular expression.  The regular expressions are

		BIN	{ws}(0w)?[0-1]+
		OCT	{ws}(0w)?[0-7]+
		DEC	{ws}(0w)?[0-9]+
		HEX	{ws}(0w?[xX])?[0-9a-fA-F]+

	where {ws} matches optional leading white space.

	TILT's implementation accepts the prefix 0W for any base and the
	prefix 0w for hex.  In particular, the following code should
	terminate and does not because fromString and scan accept the
	wrong regular expressions.

Code:
	val () =
		let
			open StringCvt
			val SOME 0w0 = Word.fromString "0w20Af"
			val SOME 0w0 = Word.fromString "0W1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word.scan DEC) "0W1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word.scan OCT) "0W1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word.scan HEX) "0w1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word.scan HEX) "0W1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word.scan BIN) "0W1"

			val SOME 0w0 = Word8.fromString "0w20Af"
			val SOME 0w0 = Word8.fromString "0W1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word8.scan DEC) "0W1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word8.scan OCT) "0W1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word8.scan HEX) "0w1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word8.scan HEX) "0W1"
			val SOME 0w0 = scanString (Word8.scan BIN) "0W1"
		in	()
		end
