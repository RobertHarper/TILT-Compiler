	[Leaf] This was actually an elaborator/phase splitter bug.  The phase
	splitter takes advantage of elaborator invariants that were not 
	correctly being maintained: in particular that datatype labels
	are never actually used (since we inline constructors).
	
Fix:         
	[Leaf] More sanity checking code was added to the phase-splitter.
	Derek fixed the actual bug in the elaborator.
