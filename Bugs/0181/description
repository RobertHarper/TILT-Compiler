Title:	Discarding unused variable names for improved scalability.

Problem:

	Added a stats flag "KeepVarNames" to name.sml, default to
	true.  For very large files (e.g.  large portions of tilt
	compiled whole program), the store of variable names kept in
	the VarMap in name.sml comes to dominate the memory usage.
	This surprises me somewhat, but empirically, not keeping names
	for variables reduces memory usage for large files by at least
	a factor of 3, particularly late in the compilation.

	An alternative would be to add a pass which gcs the store of
	variables periodically.  This would be easy to do with the
	re-writers.

Comments:

	We should implement Leaf's suggestion.

	1. Eliminate KeepVarNames and supporting code.

	2. Change

		reset_varmap : unit -> unit

	to take a list of variables whose names should not be discarded:

		reset_varmap : var list -> unit

	3. Change existing applications of reset_varmap to reset_varmap nil.

	4.  Implement passes that reset_varmap with the variables
	mentioned in Nil/Lil modules and call them from Linknil and
	Linklil.  As Leaf suggests, this is simple with the rewriters.
	Use flags to control whether variables are reset after each
	"normal" pass and apply sane defaults.
