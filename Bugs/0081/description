Problem:
	The TILT-compiled compiler crashes with a SEGV
	while Reifying MLLrValsFun.
Code:
Transcript:
	A compilation log is in ./log
	A list of mmaps is in ./mmaps
	A list of stacklet mmaps is in ./mmaps-stk
Comments:
	The SEGV occurs at ./asm/splay-set-fn.sml.s:5110.
	We are trying to write our return address to the stack.

	The write address is A = $sp + 92 = 0xeead1fec.  A
	lies in memory region RD = [0xeead0000, 0xeeb24000)
	that was mapped at log:7428.  RD looks like

		RD = primary[172032] replica[172032]
		primary = guard[8192] C[32768] ML[130944] k[128]
		replica = guard[8192] C[32768] ML[130944] k[128]

	Address A is at offset 8172 into RD; it lies in the primary
	guard page.

	The write to A is a stack overflow.

	Our stack limit is L = Threads[0].stackLimit =
	0xeea7a000.  L lies in the memory region R7 =
	[0xeea70000, 0xeeac4000) that was mapped at
	log:7429.

	Addresses A and L do not lie in the same stacklet.

	The top of our stack chain is S =
	StackChains[0].stacklets[StackChains[0].cursor-1] =
	0x11ca3f8.  *S describes R7:
		state = Inconsistent
		baseExtendedBottom = 0xeea72000 = primary C area
		baseBottom = 0xeea7a000 = primary ML area
		baseCursor = 0xeea99f80 = end of primary ML area
		baseTop = 0xeea99f80 = end of primary ML area
		retadd = 0x1ea5d4 = ./asm/splay-set-fn.sml.s:5140
		replicaCursor = 0xeea995f0 = offset 128496 in primary ML
		replicaRetadd = 0xadeb68

	SP is invalid, meaning it does point into the top
	stacklet on the current stack chain.

	Consider the function prolog code
	./asm/splay-set-fn.sml.s:5097,5107.
	NewStackletFromMutator arranges for both SP and
	LINK to be updated.  SP does not point into the
	current stacklet.  LINK = $o7 = 0x1ea5d4 =
	./asm/splay-set-fn.sml.s:#109242,#109281
	and not PopStackletFromML.  We conclude
	NewStackletFromML was not called.  In particular,
	the prolog did not change SP dramatically and did
	not change  the stack limit at all.

	SP was invalid when this function began.

	Added some debugging output.  @diag now logs
	stacklet allocation.  See the new compile in ./log4

	The last stacklet operation (log4:35680) had:
		caller asm/normalize.sml.s:9349
		callee asm/normalize.sml.s:8792

	The problem was in our handling of exceptions.  We must
	activate an exception handler's stack frame before jumping to
	its code.  We were doing this incorrectly.  We changed SP
	without regard for the runtime's chain of stacklets.
Fix:
	The fix is to pop stacklets while raising an exception.

	The code to do this is delicate.  First, we use different
	register conventions while raising an exception.  Second, the
	register allocator is not available since we are switching
	stack frames and it is unclear how to get spilling right in
	this situation.  See the translations of Rtl.RESTORESP for
	details.

	I defined a runtime function to establish the correct stacklet
	chain for the mutator's SP.  It is extremely rare for an
	exception to cross a stacklet boundary and switching between
	the mutator and the runtime is expensive.  So my translation
	of RESTORESP tests if the handler's stack frame lies in the
	current stacklet and avoids the call to the runtime in that
	case.
