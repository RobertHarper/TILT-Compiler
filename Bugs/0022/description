Title:       TILT doesn't distinguish between errors in source programs and compiler errors.
Keywords:    
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>
Date:        9/7/00
Version:     CVS
System:	     any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	The types returned by the parser and elaborator should
	reflect whether the source was ilformed.

	The error/BUG exception mechanism should only be used
	for compiler errors.

	True slaves (as opposed to "self" slaves) should continue
	to run if they encounter a user program error.
