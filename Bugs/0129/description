Title:       printing is lost under test harness
Keywords:    stdio, exit
Submitter:   rwh

Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    major
Problem:

	When run in harness, the output does not agree; when run by hand,
	output is correct.  race condition?

	The harness collects output in a pipe.  It is likely that (1) if
	output is not to a tty, then TextIO does not flush at the end of
	each line and (2) OS.Process.exit does not flushing buffers.

	The problem can be reproduced outside the test harness by printing
	less than a line of text.  The following code does not print
	anything.

Code:

	val _ = TextIO.output(TextIO.stdOut, "hello")
	val _ = OS.Process.exit OS.Process.success

Comments:

	OS.Process.exit is properly invoking TiltCleanUp.  The problem is
	this is the only place in the entire Basis library that
	TiltCleanUp is used; the code to flush output buffers is not being
	installed with TiltCleanUp by the IO libraries.

		../../Basis/Unix/os-process.sml
		../../Basis/IO/text-io-fn.sml
		../../Basis/IO/bin-io-fn.sml

Fix:

	Replaced our copy of the NJ structures CleanUp and CleanIO with a
	single structure TiltCleanUp that has a simpler interface.
	Changed OS.Process.atExit, OS.Process.exit, TextIO, and BinIO to
	use TiltCleanUp.
