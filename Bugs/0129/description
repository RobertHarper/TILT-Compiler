Title:       printing is lost under test harness
Keywords:    stdio, exit
Submitter:   rwh
Date:        08/16/02
Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    minor
Problem:     when run in harness, the output does not agree; when run by hand, output is correct.  race condition?

	The harness collects output in a pipe.  It is likely that (1) if
	output is not to a tty, then TextIO does not flush at the end of
	each line and (2) OS.Process.exit does not flushing buffers.

Code:        
	val _ = (TextIO.output (TextIO.stdOut, "hello\n")
		 ; OS.Process.exit OS.Process.success)
