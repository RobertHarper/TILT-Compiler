Problem:     unresolved overloading

	There are two problems.

	First, given a series of unresolved overloading errors, TILT
	was printing the first then bombing.  The compiler should
	print all the errors then reject the user program.

	Second, the code should elaborate.

Code:

	(*$import Word8Vector *)
	val b : Word8Vector.vector = Word8Vector.fromList []
	val test10a:unit = ignore(Word8Vector.map (fn x => 0w2*x) b)

Comments:

	Resolve_all_overloads was resolving top-level overloads
	bottom-up.  In this case, the compiler was trying to resolve
	the overloading for 0w2 before first resolving the overloading
	for op*.  Functor- and structure-level overload resolution
	(handled by resolve_overload) was similarly broken.

Fix:

	Overload information is now pulled out of the overload table
	in FIFO order rather than LIFO order.
