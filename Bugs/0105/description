Problem:     unresolved overloading

	There are two problems.

	First, given a series of unresolved overloading errors, TILT
	was printing the first then bombing.  The compiler should
	print all the errors then reject the user program.

	Second, the code below should elaborate; that is, the
	overloaded special constant appears in a context that
	constrains its type to Word8.word.

Code:

	(*$import Word8Vector *)
	val b : Word8Vector.vector = Word8Vector.fromList []
	val test10a:unit = ignore(Word8Vector.map (fn x => 0w2*x) b)

Comments:

	Resolve_all_overloads was resolving top-level overloads in
	LIFO order.  Using FIFO order fixed the bug.

	Resolve_overloads was resolving functor- and structure-level
	overloads in LIFO order.  Thus, the compiler failed on the
	code in bugs.sml and bugf.sml.  Using FIFO order fixed the
	bug.
