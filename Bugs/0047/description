Title:       Mishandling ref in patterns.
Keywords:    Elaborator, patterns, ref

Version:     CVS
System:	     any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	I'm not sure if this is a bug or not.  The pattern fails.
Code:
	(*$import *)
	type 'a myref = 'a ref
	(* local val a : int myref = ref 0 in val (ref works1) = a end *)
	val fails : 'a myref = ref 0 (* shouldn't the type be int myref? *)

	This is not a bug:  because of the explicit type variable,
	we must be able to prove 0 : 'a, which is false.

	Our error message could be better, though.
