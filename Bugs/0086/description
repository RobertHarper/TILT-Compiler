Title:       Matching against an external interface file is broken.
Submitter:   Derek Dreyer <dreyer@cs.cmu.edu>

Severity:    major
Problem:

The function LinkIl.elab_dec_constrained, which matches an
implementation against specs from external interface file appears to
be implemented incorrectly.  There is a confusing comment explaining
how it works, but it is very clear that it does some form of
transparent signature matching.  Dave and I agree that this is wrong.
Matching against an external interface file should be opaque.

In order to do transparent signature matching, elab_dec_constrained
calls Toil.xdecspec, which in turn calls Signature.xcoerce_seal and
uses the "leaky" transparent signature "sig_coerced" returned by xcoerce_seal.
I don't know why xcoerce_seal returns any transparent signature at all,
but sig_coerced is not necessarily well-formed in the ambient context.
In particular, it may refer to the locally-bound variable var_actual.
So xcoerce_seal should not be used to do transparent signature
ascription (I believe).

Fix:

Dave and I agree that both problems should be easily solvable by
making the process of matching against interface files just use
opaque signature ascription.  This should eliminate the need for
xdecspec as well.  Perry may have had reasons for this that we don't
understand, though.

External interfaces are now opaque.  xcoerced_seal no longer tries to
return a transparant signature; these "leaky" signatures were not well
formed unless the module being coerced was valuable and they are no
longer needed.  -dave
