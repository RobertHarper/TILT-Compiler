System:	     solaris
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	While bootstrapping, TILT complained with the following
	error:
		[Parsing /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/fox-28/member/swasey/ml96/Rtl/pprtl.sml]
		/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/fox-28/member/swasey/ml96/Rtl/pprtl.sml:385.1 Error: non-Ascii character
		tilt: linkparse.sml: File /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/fox-28/member/swasey/ml96/Rtl/pprtl.sml could not be parsed as an implementation file

	The file pprtp.sml has spaces on the last line.  Deleting this last
	line allowed the parse to continue.  Deleting all but the last line
	allowed the parse to continue.
Code:	     pprtl.sml
