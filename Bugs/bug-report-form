Please fill out as many of the fields as you can, as
completely as you can.  In particular, it is very important
to supply code that will reproduce the problem, if at all
possible.  Unless we can reproduce the problem ourselves it
is unlikely we will be able to eliminate the bug.

Fields with * will be filled out by us.  Please replace the
descriptions in angle brackets with your information.

Please email bug reports to til-bugs@cs.cmu.edu.
