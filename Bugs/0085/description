Title:       Elaborator/pattern compiler generate wrong expcetions
Keywords:    Elaborator, pattern compiler, exceptions
Submitter:   Leaf Petersen <leaf@cs.cmu.edu>

Version:     CVS
System:	     all
Severity:    major
Problem:     
	Either the pattern compiler or the elaborator is using the
wrong (or inconsistent) exceptions.  The match exception raised by an
incomplete pattern is not the same one tested against by a "handle
Match" pattern.

Code:	     

(*This should evaluate to false
 *)
val y = (case 3 of 0 => true) handle Match => false

Proc 0: Thread 0 (0): Uncaught exception match

Comments:    

The exception that is raised (above) is the following:

inj_exn[match]{}[](tag(NAME_match_258, UNIT), record())

The exception that is tested against is the following:

select[stamp]{}[](_r_47437)

where _r_47437 is an import:

Match_r > _r_47437 : Unknown : DEP_RECORD[ stamp > _47438, mk > _47439](EXNTAG(UNIT), EXN)

Fix:	     

	The elaborator now looks up Bind and Match from context.
