This is a good place to document and track known bugs.  For example,
you can get a rough idea of the current bugs with:

        grep open buglist.txt

You can get more details for bug number n by looking at n/description.

This directory contains files buglist.txt and bug-report-form and a
four-digit directory for each bug.  Each bug directory has a file
called description which describes the bug and provides a road-map to
any additional files.  Buglist.txt provides a synopsis and is used to
assign bug numbers (see below).  Bug-report-form is a template
description file.

To carve out a new bug report:
        1. Add a one-line description to buglist.txt, using the next
           available bug number, and check that file in.  If someone has
           already claimed that bug number, CVS will report a conflict.
           Resolve the conflict (pick another bug number) and retry.

        2. Create the numbered directory (please use leading zeros)
           and description file for your bug, using bug-report-form as
           a template.  Commit this directory to CVS when appropriate.

The Number, Status, and Title fields in a bug's description file should
match buglist.txt.

I borrowed the template from SML/NJ.  Filling it out is straight-forward.
I have not written any tools that parse these files, so there are no hard
formatting conventions.  I try to indent the contents of each field.
I have been ignoring the Test field, setting the Owner field to the CS
userid of whoever should work on the bug, and setting the Status field
to either open or closed.
