Title:       name clash problem in ld
Keywords:    ld, elaboration
Submitter:   rwh
Date:        08/18/02
Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    critical
Problem:     despite name-mangling, we still get crashes from ld because of multiply-defined identifiers.  in this test file, if you replace "hd_" by "hd", ld will reject.
