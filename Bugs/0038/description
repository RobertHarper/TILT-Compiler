Problem:
	Elaboration of the following code fails to terminate.
		signature NWIZ =
		sig
		
		  type exp_
		      
		  datatype CCconditionCode =
		      CCExp  of exp_
		    | CCAnd  of CCconditionCode * CCconditionCode
		    | CCOr   of CCconditionCode * CCconditionCode
		    | CCNot  of CCconditionCode 
		end
		
		structure EverythingWiz : NWIZ =
		struct
		    
		  datatype Sswitch =
		      SIfthenelse of {arg : CCconditionCode,             
		                      thenArm : exp_,
		                      elseArm : exp_}
		  and Eexp =
		      EVar
		    | ESwitch of Sswitch
		      
		  and CCconditionCode =
		      CCExp  of exp_
		    | CCAnd  of CCconditionCode * CCconditionCode
		    | CCOr   of CCconditionCode * CCconditionCode
		    | CCNot  of CCconditionCode
		      
		  withtype exp_ = Eexp
		end
	This comes up with Tom's wizard.

	The code to compare two CON_MU's was not doing
