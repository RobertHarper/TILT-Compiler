Title:       Pattern compiler rejects some redundant patterns.
Keywords:    elaborator,pattern compiler,redundant matches
Submitter:   swasey
Date:        10/15/02
Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    reject
Problem:

	TITL does not elaborate

		val f = fn x :: xr => xr | true::_ => []

	or

		val f = fn (x : int) => 10 | y => 11

	In both cases, the compiler should issue a redundant match warning
	and continue compilation.  (See page 28 of the Definition.)

Code:        
Transcript:  
Comments:

	With the first example, TILT bombs in untilSelfWild with
	"untilPred: matched empty".

	With the second, TILT rejects with "Redundant matches".

	Check that the pattern compiler properly handles other forms of
	redundant and non-exhaustive matches.
