Title:       pattern compiler rejecting valid code
Keywords:    elaborator,pattern compiler,redundant matches
Submitter:   swasey
Date:        10/15/02
Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    reject
Problem:
	With the code

		val f = fn x :: xr => xr
		         | true::_ => []

	the compiler bombs in untilSelfWild with "untilPred: matched empty"

	With the code

		val f = fn (x : int) => 10
		         | y => 11

	the compiler rejects with "Redundant matches"

	In both cases, the compiler should issue a redundant match warning
	and continue compilation.  (See page 28 of the Definition.)
Code:        
Transcript:  
Comments:

	Check that the pattern compiler properly handles other forms
	of redundant and non-exhaustive matches.
