Keywords:    Elaborator, phase-splitter, type inference
Submitter:   Tom Murphy <twm@andrew.cmu.edu>

Version:     CVS
System:	     any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	This code doesn't elaborate:

	val (a, b) = raise Bind

	  [Elaborating Bench/bug.sml non-constrained]
	gc_context: 347 items in original context.  1 items in reduced context.
	  [writing Bench/TM/any/bug.sml.ilError: ilcontexteq.sml: cannot
	simplify unresolved CON_TYVAR

	This code doesn't phasesplit:

	fun f () =
	   let val (a, b) = raise Bind
	   in ()
	   end

	===== Starting Phasesplit: bug                           =====
	  Initial context is phase-split
	Error: tonil.sml: (derefTyvar)  tyvar unset

Comments:
	Regarding Tom's bug report.  I agree both of these are bugs and will
	look into fixing them later.  Note that the related programs

		val a = raise Bind
		fun f () = let val a = raise Bind in () end

	compile fine.  I think TILT should behave the same way no matter what
	form of pattern appears on the left.
Fix:
