Title:	Directly writing TAL modules for speed.
Keywords:	scalability

Severity:	cosmetic
Problem:

	[I] added a function to TAL/pp.sml which writes a TAL module
	directly to an outstream instead of consing up a huge
	serialized string data structure, and then writing that out.
	This makes a huge difference for large files.  I only had time
	to implement this for the top level function: each individual
	code block is still serialized and then written out
	separately.  In practice, this seems to be sufficient since
	code blocks don't generally grow arbitrarily with file size,
	but it might be worth rewriting this entirely at some point.
	This also involved some small changes to talout.sml as well.
