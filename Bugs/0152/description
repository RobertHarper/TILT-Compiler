Problem:     

A type should match an (abstract) eqtype spec iff the type supports
equality.  Currently, the test of this seems to be whether the type
carries around an equality function with it.  In the example code
below, this is not the case, and in general we should not expect it to
be the case.  In particular, we should perform equality compilation on
at signature matching if the type doesn't come with its own equality
function.

Code:        

(*$import *)

signature S = sig type t = int end
signature S' = sig eqtype t end
structure X :> S = struct type t = int end
structure X' :> S' = X

Error: value specification but missing component: +Et_INT

Fix:         

	The coercion compiler now invokes the equality compiler.
	See ../0050/description for more info.
