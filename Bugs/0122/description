	More info on the exn:
	
	uncaught exception overflow
	  raised at: Util/tilword64.sml:141.22-141.30
	             Parser/frontend.sml:113.32
	             Top/slave.sml:82.17
	-

	The lexer fails because it does not check for overflow
	when converting string literals to TilWord64.word.

	Note that there are additional range checks check_int and
	check_uint in toil.sml.  These never get to fail.

Fix:

	It is now counted as a parse error when literals overflow.

	N.B. We still fail m0061 because we do not provide InfInt.

Test: m0061
