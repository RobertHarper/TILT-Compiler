Title:	TAL can fail to find interface files generated by TILT.
Keywords:	talx86, Manager
Submitter:	swasey@cs.cmu.edu
Date:	2/4/04
Version:	CVS
System:	linux
Severity:	exception
Problem:

	TILT uses relative paths to TAL interface files in TAL assembler
	files; the relative paths have the form

		UnitName/talx86/tali

	TILT sends TAL a list of include directories on the command line
	so that all such relative paths can be resolved; for example,

		-Iabsolute_path/TM/project_file

	In TAL 1.6, Talbe.find_interface searches this list of include
	directories if the named file does not exist in the current
	directory.

	It is possible, if the user has a file named
	./UnitName/talx86/tali, for TAL's find_interface to map a relative
	file name in a TAL assembler file to the user's file rather than
	the TAL interface generated by TILT.

Comments:

	We could propose a modest change to the tal tools: A command line
	flag that prevents Talbe.find_interface from searching the current
	directory first and prevents Gcd.compile_file from adding include
	directories to the list.

	Alternatively, we could have the Manager switch to an empty
	directory prior to invoking TAL.

	We decided to generate a patch to talc for Tom to commit.
