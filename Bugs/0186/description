Title:	Improve sparc runtime's large object allocation.
Keywords:	runtime, large object space, GC

Problem:

	The sparc GC has a large object space.  The mutator allocates
	large arrays in the LOS.  C code in the runtime always
	allocates in the nursery; for example, posix_io_read allocates
	the string it returns from the nursery.

	For regularity, and possibly to improve performance, the
	runtime should allocate large objects exactly as the mutator
	does.

Comments:

	IIRC, the runtime only allocates large string arrays.

	The code to modify is
	../../Runtime/sparc/create.c:/alloc_space

	The code to emulate is ../../Rtl/tortl-array.sml:/xarray_int

	xarray_int calls ../../Runtime/sparc/gc.c:/^alloc_bigintarray
	to allocate arrays larger than 2048 bytes (including GC tag,
	etc).

	As you fix this bug, find out if it helps performance; for
	example, measure the time it takes to compile the basis before
	and after the change.
