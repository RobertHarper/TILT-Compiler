Title:	Improve support for project description file parameters.
Keywords:	manager, project descriptions
Submitter:	David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>
Date:	7/7/05
Version:	CVS
System:	any
Severity:	cosmetic
Problem:

	In creating "tilt2" for his work on recursive modules, Derek
	opined that the combination

		val x = e
		include "file"

	is confusing because the user may expect that file can contain
	free references to x.

	These value declarations are really parameters.  We have a
	second source of parameters: The environment.  I think we
	should eliminate value declarations and improve our support
	for environment variables.

	The manager's current set of pre-defined identifiers
	($linking, $cputype, etc) can be made available as simulated
	environment variables.

	The manager should require project description files to
	declare environment variables prior to using them.

		env NAME : TY

	where TY can be string, int, bool.  The manager stops if NAME
	is not in the environment or can not be parsed as a value of
	type TY. This makes finding typos in uses of NAME easier and
	supports non-string env variables.

	Aside: It was silly not to overload = given the attempt to
	make the expressions in project description files feel like
	ML. That should be fixed.
