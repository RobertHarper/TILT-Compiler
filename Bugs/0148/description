[Derek] We have decided not to follow the Definition on this point
because the Definition doesn't make sense.  In particular, the
Definition says that type t1 = tau1 and ... and tn = taun, when
appearing in a declaration, is elaborated as a simultaneous binding,
whereas the same thing, appearing in a specification, is supposed to
elaborate sequentially.  Anyone who relies on this behavior is a
complete idiot.
