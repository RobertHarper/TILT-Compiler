Title:       Equality compiler generates poor code.
Keywords:    Equality
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>
Date:        5/18/2001
Version:     CVS
System:	     any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	The HIL code for datatypes, esp the equality compiler output,
	is verbose.  Compare with the phase-split version.

	Comparing modified equal.sml with previous version (CVS 1.26).
	Measure lines of code generated for triv.sml.

	(As expected, we haven't caused harm--but we didn't make any major improvement.)
Fix:
	The equality compiler now names intermediate types so that HIL
	equality functions are at least human readable.
	
	See triv.sml for some more ideas (from staring at the HIL
	code).
	
	Made minor improvements to the HIL pretty-printer.
