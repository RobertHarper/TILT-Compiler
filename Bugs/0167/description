Code:        

   val x = (raise Div) handle _ => raise Div

Transcript:  The exact error messages are as follows:

Comments:    This code should be accepted, but subject to the value restriction 
   it should be made non-polymorphic.

Fix:         

	Toil recorded tyvars as they were created so it could
	instantiate any left-over unset ones after elaboration.  The
	problem is that other parts of the elaborator created tyvars
	behind Toil's back; these were not instantiated.

	I fixed this by eliminating Toil's tyvar table in favor of
	walking over the elaboration result to hunt for unset tyvars.
