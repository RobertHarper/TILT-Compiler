System:	     all
Severity:    minor
Description: In findApp in analyze.sml, an eq_var comparison seems to use the wrong variable (v instead of f) to detect
	     an opportunity for optimization. Similarly, a recursive parameter looks like it should be v instead of cur.
Fix:         Made the changes mentioned above, and everything seems to work fine
