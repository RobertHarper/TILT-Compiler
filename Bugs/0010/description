Title:       Want a separate stack for signal handlers on alpha.
Keywords:    alpha,runtime
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>

Version:     CVS
System:	     alpha
Severity:    cosmetic
Problem:
	Have we considered using sigaltstack() (or sigstack()) to set
	aside some stack space for signal handler execution?  I think
	its possible to have the runtime's signal handler correctly
	diagnose stack overflows.  The alternative is to let the OS
	do it (killing off the process).
