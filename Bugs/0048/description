Version:     CVS
System:	     all
Severity:    major
Problem:
	(1) The IL type for ``datatype 'a foo = A of 'a | B of ('a list) foo'' is

		foo_TYC > foo_8188 = /-\(poly_8208)CON_MU(/-\(vdt_foo_8199)(SUM[(A, B); 0; (poly_8208, vdt_foo_8199)]))#0,

	which actually corresponds to ``datatype 'a foo = A of 'a | B of 'a foo''.

		(1a) The odd type translation could mean that datatypes exist which are uniform but which
		     we translate incorrectly.
		(1b) this should be rejected with "non-uniform datatypes are not supported"

	(2) The error messages for ``datatype 'a foo = A of bar and bar = B of int foo'' are not clear.

		(2a) this should be rejected with "non-uniform datatypes are not supported"

	(3) Lack of alpha conversion prevents elaboration of ``datatype 'a foo = A of 'a bar and 'b bar = B of 'b foo''

	(4) ``datatype ('a,'a) foo = A of 'a'' elaborates but should fail due to the duplicate bound variable.

Fix:
	[Supporting files in CVS prior to 1/6/04.]

	Most of the changes were in Elaborator/datatype.sml.  I also
	added alpha conversion support for AST tyvars to AstHelp.

	The datatype compiler performs a number of syntactic checks
	before attempting a translation.  This took care of (1), (2),
	and (4).  The translation of a single strongly-connected type
	performs alpha-conversion.  This took care of (3).
