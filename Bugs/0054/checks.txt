2.9 Syntactic Restrictions

. No expression row, pattern row or type-expression row may bind the
  same lab twice.

. No binding valbind, typbind, datbind or exbind may bind the same
  identifier twice; this applies also to value identifiers within
  a datbind.

. No tyvarseq may contain the same tyvar twice.

. For each value binding pat = exp within rec, exp must be of the form
  fn match.

. No datbind, valbind or exbind may bind true, false, nil, :: or ref.
  No datbind or exbind may bind it.

* No real constant may occur in a pattern.

* In a value declaration val tyvarseq valbind, if valbind contains another
  declaration val tyvarseq' valbind' then tyvarseq and tyvarseq' must be
  disjoint.  In other words, no type variable may be scoped by two value
  declarations of which one occurs inside the other.  This restriction
  applies after tyvarseq and tyvarseq' have been extended to include
  implicitly scoped type variables, as explained in Secion 4.6.

3.5 Syntactic Restrictions

. No binding strbind, sigbind, or funbind may bind the same identifier
  twice.

. No description valdesc, typdesc, datdesc, exdesc or strdesc may describe
  the same identifier twice; this applies also to value identifiers
  within a datdesc.

. No tyvarseq may contain the same tyvar twice.

* Any tyvar occurring on the right side of a datdesc of the form tyvarseq
  tycon = ... must occur in the tyvarseq; similarly, in signature
  expressions of the form sigexp where type tyvarseq longtycon = ty,
  any tyvar occurring in ty must occur in tyvarseq.

? Any tyvar occurring on the right side of a typbind or datbind of the
  form tyvarseq tycon = ... must occur in tyvarseq.

. No datdesc, valdesc or exdesc may describe true, false, nil, :: or ref.
  No datdesc or exdesc may describe it.
