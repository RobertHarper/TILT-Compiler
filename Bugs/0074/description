Title:       Manager not parallelizing enough.
Keywords:    manager

Version:     CVS
System:	     any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	The manager sometimes waits for (IL) interfaces that it knows
	are up to date and so will not change.

	For example:
		- Build the compiler, keeping all droppings.
		- Delete the Toil assembler file.
		- Touch the Manager's Compiler unit.
		- Rebuild the compiler.

	The manager's plan will be

		plan for Toil : generate
			(ie, interfaces & object file up to date)

	But compilation of Compiler will not proceed until
	the interfaces of Toil are completed by the slave.

Comments:

	The new manager gets this right.  Dependents of a unit with an
	ascribed interface can be compiled before the unit; that is, they
	only wait for the interface to be compiled.
