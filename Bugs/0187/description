Title:	Do not phase split or link units with no sbnds.

Problem:

	Source units containing only signatures and fixity, overload,
	and extern declarations elaborate to sdecs with no sbnds.
	These occur frequently in TILT's sources because most
	signatures are in their own compilation units.

	It is possible to make the manager smarter about units with no
	code: If a unit elaborates to sdecs with no sbnds, then do not
	invoke the backend and do not link the unit into executables.
	This would reduce the number of units linked and would avoid
	wasting time running the backend on trivial units.
