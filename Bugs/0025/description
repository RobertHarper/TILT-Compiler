Problem:
	Elaborator fails to terminate.
	This came up while compiling Twelf's parse-fixity.fun.sml with
	missing imports.
Code:
	(*$import *)
	(* exception A  ---  as if from a missing import *)
	exception B
	val bug = (()
		   handle A => ()
		        | B => ())
Transcript:
	tilt -fUptoElaborate mapfile
	...
	  [0 imports of total size 0 were cached.
	   0 imports of total size 0 were uncached and took 0.0 seconds.]
	  [Added contexts.]
	  [Parsing bug.sml]
	  [Elaborating bug.sml non-constrained]
	... Hangs ...
Comments:
	The problem was in the pattern match compiler.
	Exn_case, unlike constructor_case, wasn't explicity checking
	for ill-formed columns like
		_
		A
Fix:
	The missing checks were added to exn_case.
