Title:       Phase splitter rejecting valid programs.
Keywords:    Elaborator,datatype labels,where structure
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>

Version:     CVS
System:	     all
Severity:    major
Problem:
	The compiler dies while phase splitting the following code.
Code:
	signature S =
	    sig
		structure A :
		    sig
			datatype term = T
		    end
	    end
	functor JoinWithArg (structure Arg : S) :> S where A = Arg.A =
	    struct
		structure A = Arg.A
	    end

	===== Starting Phasesplit: Join                          =====
	  Initial context is phase-split
	tilt: tonil.sml: use of datatype labels detected
Comments:
	The translation of JoinWithArg mentions
		CON_PATH(funct_arg_993.Arg_STR. A_STR. B_STR. +O+Dterm_INT. term_INT)
	rather than
		CON_PATH(funct_arg_993.Arg_STR. A_STR. B_STR. term_TYC)
	This hits a sanity check in the phase splitter, causing the error message.
Fix:
	The fix was a small change to the where stucture code.
