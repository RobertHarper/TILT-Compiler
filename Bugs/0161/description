Problem:     
             TILT's accepts the following code:
      
                structure S = struct val x = 3 end;

                val y = S . x

	Steve Weeks points out:

		Section 2.5 says "each item of lexical analysis is a either a
		reserved word, a numeric label, a special constant, or a long
		identifier" and "Comments and formatting characters separate
		items ...  and are otherwise ignored".  Together, I take these
		to mean that spaces separate "S . x" into three items of
		lexical analysis.
