Title:       should not allow whitespace in long.identifier
Keywords:    parser parsing longid lexer

System:      any
Severity:    reject
Problem:     
             TILT's parser(lexer) accepts the following code:
      
                structure S = struct val x = 3 end;

                val y = S . x

             SML/NJ is the only other ML compiler I know about that 
             accepts this code. 

             Steve Weeks points out:

                Section 2.5 says "each item of lexical analysis is a
                either a reserved word, a numeric label, a special 
		constant, or a long identifier" and "Comments and 
		formatting characters separate items ... and are 
		otherwise ignored".  Together, I take these to mean 
		that spaces separate "S . x" into three items of 
		lexical analysis.

Code:        See above.
