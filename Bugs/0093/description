Title:       TILT does not support separate compilation.
Keywords:    Elaborator, Manager
Submitter:   swasey

Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	In ml96/doc/TM.txt, we wrote

		Separate compilation means different things to
		different people. We think it essential that a system
		supporting separate compilation can use a compilation
		unit without having source code for that unit.

		We stress that TILT does not currently support
		separate compilation.

	See that document to learn about our design.

	Some problems are:

	1. The elaborator may not perform interface matching
	correctly.  See bug number 86.

	2. The manager does not build up separate elaboration contexts
	for a unit's external interface and source.  The TM.txt
	document is confused on this point; contrast the sections
	"Internal Interface" and "File Dependencies".

	3. The manager does not permit a compilation unit with an
	external interface file but no source.  Most of the machinery
	described in the "Canidate Implementations" section of TM.txt
	is missing.

Fix:

	Implemented separate compilation.  TM.txt needs to be updated
	for the new manager.  -dave
