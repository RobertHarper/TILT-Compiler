Title:       Ugly hack: add_context_label
Keywords:    Elaborator
Submitter:   swasey
Date:        01/22/03
Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    minor
Problem:     IlContext.add_context_lable should go away and the pattern compiler should be fixed to work without it.
Code:        This gets used by patterns like "val a as b = 3".
