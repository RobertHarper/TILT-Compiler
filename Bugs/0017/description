Title:       Incorrect L2 cache size on some alphas.
Keywords:    runtime,cache

Version:     CVS
System:	     alpha
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	According to digital's documentation, tcl and forth have 16K
	instruction and data caches and a 2MB on-board cache.  This
	is not reflected in platform.c.

Comments:
	I put the right cache size into platform.c and changed the min
	heap size in GCInit_Gen from 1024K to 2560K, which should be
	sufficient for level 2 caches up to 2048K.  A similar change
	would be necessary in the parallel and concurrent generational
	collectors if they ran on a machine with a large cache.

	This fix improved performance on the alphas.  This was
	expected since the L2 cache size determines the size of the
	nursery.  A quick scan of a few of the benchmarks in Bench
	leads me to believe that they aren't the most memory-intensive
	tests.  So I performed a full rebuild of the basis in tilt/b
	with and without the more accurate L2 cache size.
