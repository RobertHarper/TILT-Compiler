Submitter:   Leaf Petersen <leaf@cs.cmu.edu>
Date:        8/8/02
Version:     CVS
System:	     any
Severity:    reject
Problem:     
	Flexible records seem to be sometimes made rigid before they
	ought to be.  This is an old bug from the buglist in the Doc
	directory.

		
Code:	     

	fun g {a,b} = a + b + 3

	fun f thunk = 
	  let val {a, ...} = thunk  
	  in  g thunk
	  end
