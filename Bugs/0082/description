Title:       Type of thunk prematurely made a rigid record

Severity:    reject
Problem:     

	Flexible records seem to be sometimes made rigid before they
	ought to be.  TILT rejects the following code.

Code:	   

	(* example 1 *)
	fun g {a,b} = a + b + 3
	fun f thunk = 
	  let val {a, ...} = thunk  
	  in  g thunk
	  end

	(* example 2 *)
	fun f(r as {...}) =
		let	fun g() = r
		in
			[r, {a=1}]
		end

	(* example 3 *)
	val _ =
		let
			val g = #foo
			val _ = g {foo = 13, goo = 1.0}
			val _ = g {foo = "yes", goo = 1.0}
		in
			()
		end

	(* example 4 *)
	val _ =
		let
			val f = #foo
			val g = fn h => fn y => h (f y)
			val h = fn x => f x
			val _ = f {foo=0, bar=1}
		in
			()
		end

	(* example 5 *)
	val f = #foo
	val g = (fn x => x) f
	val _ = f {foo=0, bar=1}

	(* example 6 *)
	structure S =
	struct
		val f = #foo
	end
	val _ = S.f {foo=1, goo=2}

Comments:

	This is an old bug from the buglist in the Doc directory.	

	The project descriptions flexrecord1, flexrecord3, flexrecord4,
	flexrecord5, flexrecord8, flexrecord9 are specific tests from
	m0071 that fail to elaborate.
