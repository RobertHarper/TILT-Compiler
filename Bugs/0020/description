Version:     CVS
System:	     solaris
Severity:    major
Problem:
	When bootstrapping, the TILT-generated compiler mistakenly complains
	about a corrupt .info file.
Code:
	tiltb mapfile-all
	or
	Test/test.sml
Transcript:

Comments:
	[Supporting files available in CVS prior to 1/6/04.]

	At the end of the file, TextIO.inputLine is returning garbage,
	not the empty string.

	Updated TextIOFn to no effect.

	With Test/test.sml, the problem occurs (its not the manager).

	The file's size is 8190 (4096 + 4094).
	The following read calls are made:

	posix_io_read(5,4096)	lines 1-88
	posix_io_read(5,4096)	lines 89-171
	posix_io_read(5,4096)	crap after line 171
	posix_io_read(5,4096)	crap after line 171

	adjust_stringlen() isn't setting the new tag value when the word length
	is unchanged.
Fix:
	Fixed adjust_stringlen.
