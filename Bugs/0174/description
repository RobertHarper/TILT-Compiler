Title:	Layout of GC tables is imperfect.

Severity:	cosmetic
Problem:

	Information about the mutator is passed to the gc using a few
	tables.  The tables are generally stored as a list of fixed-size
	entries described by a start address and an end address (a
	separate global symbol).  The linker may place padding between the
	actual end of data and the address of the end symbol.  This can
	confuse the GC.

Comments:

	Eliminate globalend and traceglobalend in favor of storing
	explicit size information along with the data.  This will involve
	changing (at least):

		../../Rtl/tortl.sml
		../../Runtime/client.h
		../../Runtime/gc.c
		../../Runtime/stack.c
