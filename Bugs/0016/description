Title:       Want raised exceptions to carry debugging information.
Keywords:    exception handling,runtime
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>

Version:     CVS
System:	     solaris,alpha
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	Exceptions should carry, at least as an option, some
	information about where the exception is raised.
	Ideally it will be possible to get a backtrace from
	the point of a raise.

	What about printing a stack trace in the top-level exception
	handler.  It should be possible for the compiler and runtime
	to do this better than, say, gdb on solaris.
