	[Leaf] This is a known problem with TILT.  We do not parse trees
	as an explicit DAG structure.  It is not clear whether we can in 
	get the same effect in general using type names.  It is relatively
	easy to put it into the right form, but harder to arrange so that 
	we always traverse the types as DAGS.  Not clear if it is in general
	possible in the typechecker, though it seems as if it ought to be.
