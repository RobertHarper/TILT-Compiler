Title:       Queue.delete is broken.
Keywords:    SML/NJ library
Submitter:   swasey
Date:        03/25/03
Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	The helper doFront in ../../Basis/Library/fifo.sml:/delete
	does not filter front elements after the first.  Thus
	Fifo.delete and Queue.delete with predicate fn _ => true can
	return non-empty queues.
Code:
