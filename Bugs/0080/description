Comments:
	[Leaf] The issue is that the phase-splitter currently lifts
        out all the sdecs that don't have an associated sbnd and processes
        them first.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work if extern specs
        refer to types defined in the file.  

Fix:
	[Leaf] It is likely that these specs can be processed in
	order,though there are some complications having to do with
	the filtering of unused elements. 

Test:
Owner: leaf
Status: open
