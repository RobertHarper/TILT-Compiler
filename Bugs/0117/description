         [tom7] This is NOT the same bug as 0112, et al., though it fails in the
         same place. Before that, there's never a "unset toplevel tyvar -- setting
	 to unit" message.

	More on the exception:
		  [Elaborating vector.sml non-constrained]

	Find_tyvars_flexes was sometimes returning tyvars that had
	already been set.  This code tickled that bug and resulted in
	a tyvar being marked for equality (with an empty eq_hole)
	after it was unified.  This violates an invariant of the
	unification routines.

Fix:

	find_tyvars_flexes was corrected and the path compression
	code was made less mysterious.
