Title:       Bugs in StringCvt.

Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    major
Problem:

	Test m0114 does not work because

	- ScanString.{splitl, takel, dropl} raise Size when no input
	matches the predicate.

	- ScanString.splitl eats an extra character when there is input
	that does not match the predicate.

Code:

Fix:

	PreString provides some utility functions that operate on
	non-empty strings or lists of characters.  StringCvt was calling
	one of these (revImplode) with an empty list.  I fixed StringCvt
	and checked every use of PreString in the basis to ensure that no
	other code uses these functions incorrectly.

	The other problem was that splitl was returning the wrong stream.
