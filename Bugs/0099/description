Problem:     does not make exceptions available after signature matching
Code:        
Transcript:  
Comments:    
The problem was that signature matching was not implemented correctly
in the case that an exception declaration was coerced to a mere value
spec, such as:

  val E : type_carried -> exn

Fix:         
The fix was to check for this case.  (It was an instance of a coercion from
a module, representing the exception, to a value spec.)
