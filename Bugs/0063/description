Severity:    major
Problem:
	Type-checking after phase-splitting fails with this code:
		(*$import *)
		signature LR_TABLE =
		    sig
		        datatype 'a pairlist = EMPTY
		    end
		functor JoinWithArg (structure ParserData: LR_TABLE) =
		struct
		    datatype 'a pairlist = datatype ParserData.pairlist
		end
Code:
	tilt -fcheckPhasesplit mapfile-bug

	You'll find some compiler output in the file `dump'.
	Constructor equivalence was failing to equate

                COERCION[ 'a_1078 ](APP(funct_arg_c_1043.ParserData. pairlist_sum,('a_1078)),
                                    APP(funct_arg_c_1043.ParserData. pairlist,('a_1078)))

	and

		COERCION[ 'a_1055 ](APP(funct_arg_c_1043.ParserData. pairlist_sum,('a_1055)),
		                    APP(funct_arg_c_1043.ParserData. pairlist,('a_1055)))

	When structurally comparing two coercion constructors, we were
	not properly alpha-varying the from- and to-types.
Fix:
	The problem was in the Coercion_c case of IlStatic's
	con_structural_equiv: We forgot to use the renaming
	substitution that we so carefully calculated.
