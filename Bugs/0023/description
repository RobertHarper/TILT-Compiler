Title:       Elaborator raising exceptions.
Keywords:    exceptions, error handling
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>
Date:        9/16/00
Version:     CVS
System:	     any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	The elaborator calls error() rather than returning values that indicate
	a user-program error in some circumstances.

	Only LinkIl should be concerned with whether or not user level errors
	result in exceptions.
Code:
	This came up while fixing imports to be non-transitive.  The errors
	I noticed most often were all due to missing imports:
	        tilt: equal.sml: elaborator impossibility: unresolved type does not permit equailty
		tilt: pat.sml: non-constructor path pattern
		tilt: toil.sml: cannot parse pattern
		tilt: pat.sml: untilPred: matched empty
		      datatype c = C
		      fun bug (A) = ()
		        | bug (C) = ()

Comments:

	The elaborator is now using Util.reject rather than Util.error
	for user code errors.
