Transcript:
	Running the TILT executable produces:
		Defaulting to model DEC3000_500
		Proc 0:  Memory error at 438127604 with PC = 0
		SEGV_MAPERR  address 438127604 not mapped
	Note 438127604 = 0x1a1d4bf4.

	Running a Hello, World executable produces:
		Defaulting to model DEC3000_500
		Proc 0:  Memory error at 436370196 with PC = 0
		SEGV_MAPERR  address 436370196 not mapped
	Note 436370196 = 0x1a027b14.
