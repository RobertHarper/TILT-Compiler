System:      any
Severity:    critical
Problem:
	The elaborator bombs on the following code.
Code:        
	    fun seal (i : {main : unit * unit}) : unit =
		let val {main=(v,sig_target),...} = i
		in  ()
		end
Transcript:  
Comments:    
	It looks like the pattern compiler is calling GetExpCon
	on a variable it has not bound into context.
Fix:
