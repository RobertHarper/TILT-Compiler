Title:       Pattern compiler causing elaborator to bomb.
Keywords:    Pattern compiler, records and tuples
Submitter:   swasey
Date:        04/15/03
Version:     CVS
System:      any
Severity:    critical
Problem:
	The elaborator bombs on the following code.
Code:        
	    fun seal (i : {main : unit * unit}) : unit =
		let val {main=(v,sig_target),...} = i
		in  ()
		end

Comments:
	The pattern compiler's reduce_let was returning a variable
	expression where the variable was not bound.

	For example, an expression like

		let a = bindarg#main
		    b = a#1
		    c = a#2
		in  (b,c)
		end

	was being reduced, incorrectly, to

		a

	This is fixed in my working directory.
	The fix is not yet in CVS.
