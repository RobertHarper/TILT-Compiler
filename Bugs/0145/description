Severity:    library
Problem:

	Test m0120 fails for the following reasons:

	Time.fromReal 1E300 = exception overflow (expected exception Time)
	Time.fmt ~1 454.501701 = "454" (expected "455")
	Time.fmt 0 454.501701 = "454" (expected "455")
	Time.fmt 3 454.501701 = "454.501" (expected "454.502")

Code:        
	val _ =
		let	val _ = print "Time.fromReal 1E300 = "
			val s =
				(Time.toString(Time.fromReal 1E300)
				handle e => "exception " ^ exnMessage e)
			val _ = print (s ^ " (expected exception Time)\n")
		in	()
		end
	
	val t : Time.time = Time.+(Time.fromSeconds 454, Time.fromMicroseconds 501701)
	
	fun test (prec:int, r:string) : unit =
		let	val s = Time.fmt prec t
		in	if s=r then ()
			else print ("Time.fmt " ^ Int.toString prec ^ " 454.501701 = \"" ^
				s ^ "\" (expected \"" ^ r ^ "\")\n")
		end
	
	val _ = app test
	[
		(~1,"455"),
		(0,"455"),
		(1,"454.5"),
		(2,"454.50"),
		(3,"454.502"),
		(4,"454.5017"),
		(5,"454.50170"),
		(6,"454.501701")
