Number: 0095
Title:       Errno is sometimes clobbered.
Keywords:    Runtime
Submitter:   swasey
Date:        08/16/02
Version:     CVS
System:      solaris
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	You will be able to reproduce this bug on cuff if bug number
	94 has not been fixed.  If bug 94 has been fixed, you will
	need to arrange for fork to fail somehow.  For example, you
	could find and use a program that deliberately consumes all
	virtual memory.

	The problem is that when posix_process_fork fails, it raises a
	SysErr exception with errno=22 (EINVAL) on Solaris while truss
	reports that fork1 failed with errno=12 (ENOMEM).

	Hunch: This is due to our use of threads.  Inspect those
	manual pages.

Code:
	(*$import Prelude TopLevel POSIX_Process *)

	structure test =
	struct
	    val _ = POSIX_Process.fork ()
	end
