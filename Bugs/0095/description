Title:       Errno is sometimes clobbered leading to incorrect SysErr exceptions from the runtime.
Keywords:    Runtime

Severity:    major
Problem:

	The runtime is throwing SysErr exceptions (when an error actually
	occurs) with the wrong error message.

	Originally, the bug came up with the following code:

		structure test =
		struct
		    val _ = POSIX_Process.fork ()
		end

	At the time, the runtime demanded a large amount of virtual memory
	so fork posix_process_fork would fail (this was fixed; see bug 94)
	The problem is it raised a SysErr exception with errno=22 (EINVAL)
	on Solaris while truss reports that fork1 failed with errno=12
	(ENOMEM).

	Hunch: This is due to our use of threads; errno is thread-local.
	Inspect those manual pages.

	I spotted this bug again in January, 2004 while doing a parallel
	make on solaris.

	The bug is apparantly reliably reproduced with the following
	project on cuff:

		(* project *)
		unit Test = "test.sml" {OS}

		(* test.sml *)
		val _ = OS.FileSys.remove "nosuchfile"

	Running

		rm nosuchfile	# just in case
		tilt-nj -o test.exe -c Test project
		./test.exe

	on cuff yields

		Proc 0: Thread 0 (0): Uncaught exception SysErr: Invalid argument (errno=22)

	Truss shows that unlink() set errno=2 (No such file or directory)
	but the SysErr shows errno=22.

	<ASIDE>
	The value 22 in in the SysErr exception comes from the
	processor_info loop around

		../../Runtime/thread.c:/processor_info

	If we handle the case when a processor number is not added to
	activeProcs[] with "else errno = 0", then the program terminates
	with

		Proc 0: Thread 0 (0): Uncaught exception SysErr: Error 0 (errno=0)
	</ASIDE>

	The file /usr/include/errno.h mentions a macro _REENTRANT.  If
	this is defined (or some other conditions are satisfied), then
	errno is thread-specific; otherwise it is not.  The manual page
	intro(2) verifies that defining this macro is required for
	multi-threaded applications.  (It would be nice if the pthreads
	manual pages mentioned this or if Solaris got it right without a
	magic macro.)

Fix:

	I changed the runtime's makefile to invoke the Solaris C compiler
	with -D_REENTRANT.  This solved the problem.
