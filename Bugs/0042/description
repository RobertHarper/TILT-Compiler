Title:       Runtime not being made up-to-date.
Keywords:    Runtime,gmake
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>
Date:        2/16/01
Version:     CVS
System:	     any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	Every now and again "gmake runtime" will fail to compile
	something which needs to be compiled.  The runtime gets out of
	wack and eventually causes strange problems when used as part
	of an executable.

	I'm saving bad Runtime directories.  Eventually we need to
	rip them open and find out whats wrong.

	   tom.tar.gz		GCFromML() and work() disagree about request_disp (offset of th->request)
