Title:       Parsing of infix(r) declarations is not correct.
Keywords:    SML/NJ parser parsing infix picky

System:      any
Severity:    minor
Problem:     

     The SML/NJ parser parses infix(r) declarations incorrectly,
     primarily because it does not look for a single decimal
     digit after infix(r), and instead attempts to lex the next
     token and extract a number from it. This can result in
     correct programs being rejected, incorrect programs being
     accepted, and incorrect program behavior.

Code:

     Some declarations that should be accepted:

     infix 0x0
     infix 0e0
     infix 0w0
     
     infix 0x90 a

     Some declarations that should be rejected:

     infix 00 x
     infix ~0 x

     Example code that runs incorrectly:

     (* should parse as infix 0 x0 l,
	  but parses as infix 0 l *)
     infix 0x0 l
	
     val op x0 = 0
     fun f _ _ = 2
     fun f x0 0 = 1
       | f x0 x = f 0 (x - 1)

     val x = if f x0 1 = 1 then print "WRONG\n"
 	                   else print "OK\n"
