Title:       "where strid=strid" signature patching extension is incompatible with SML.
Keywords:    parser

Problem:

	Test m0129 fails because TILT attempts to parse code like

		signature T = sig type t end where type t = int and U = sig end

	as a single signature binding with a type patch and a "structure
	patch" (an extension).  This code should bind two signatures.

	We could eliminate structure patching.

	We could change signature patching to force the use of the token
	"where" rather than "and" when patching structures; "and type
	x=ty" should still be permitted, of course.
