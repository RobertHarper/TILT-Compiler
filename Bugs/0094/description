Title:       The Runtime uses too much virtual memory.
Keywords:    Runtime
Submitter:   swasey
Date:        08/16/02
Version:     CVS
System:      solaris,alpha
Severity:    major
Problem:
	Our technique of grabbing as much virtual memory as there is
	physical memory can cause TILT-generated binaries to fail on
	startup or on fork().

	On Solaris, fork1() fails with ENOMEM if there is not enough
	virtual memory to accomodate parent and child.

	Example: Fill up /tmp on cuff with a copy of TILT or some
	other large files.  This consumes swap space.  Then run the
	program below under truss.  You will see that the call to
	fork1() in fails with ENOMEM.

Code:
	(*$import Prelude TopLevel POSIX_Process *)

	structure test =
	struct
	    val _ = POSIX_Process.fork ()
	end

	During the TILT work week, Daniel Spoonhower and Perry Cheng
	worked on a plan to fix this problem.
