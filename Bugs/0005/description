Title:       Possible code generation error.

Version:     CVS
System:	     alpha,solaris
Severity:    major
Problem:
	The translation of (Rtl.NEEDMUTATE 22) includes an add with
	immediate operand of 264, which is too large for the 8-bit
	slot available in the instruction.  This comes up while
	bootstrapping.
Code:	     
Transcript:
	Starting translation to TIL-Alpha assembly
	 There are 59 procedures and  59 recursive components with the largest being of size 1
	exn raised during translation of Rtl instruction:
	  needmutate 22
	tilt: alpha/toalpha.sml: immediate out of range: 264
Comments:
Fix:
	Check with Perry to make sure (NEEDMUTATE 22) is sane.  If so,
	change that arm of Toalpha.translate (file Alpha/toalpha.sml
	around lines 1064-1081) to generate different code if the
	immediate values needed are bigger than 8 bits.

	Perry says:
	>NEEDMUTATE 22 is a valid instruction.  The translation is faulty 
	>though if, as you said, it turns it into a too large immediate.
	>I suspect that the same bug exists in the sparc too so can you fix
	>both versions?
	>
	>Incidentally, NEEDMUTATE 22 means that space in the write buffer for
	>22 mutations is required.  Each mutation entry is 3 words or 12 bytes.
	>And hence, 22 * 12 = 264 bytes.

	Fixed in both Alpha/toalpha.sml and Sparc/tosparc.sml.
Test:
	On the alpha, Basis/Library/hash-table-fn.sml uses both kinds of
	NEEDMUTATE code.  The generated code for small values looks like:
			ldl     $0, 1076($12)
			ldl     $1, 1080($12)
			addl    $0, 12, $0
			cmple   $0, $1, $0
			bne     $0, afterMutateCheck_15460
		code_15462:
			subl    $13, 12, $at
			jsr     $26, GCFromML
		afterMutateCheck_15460:
	For large values it looks like:
			ldl     $2, 1076($12)
			ldl     $1, 1080($12)
			lda     $0, 264($31)
			addl    $2, $0, $0
			cmple   $0, $1, $0
			bne     $0, afterMutateCheck_16225
		code_16227:
			lda     $at, 264($31)
			subl    $13, $at, $at
			jsr     $26, GCFromML
		afterMutateCheck_16225:
