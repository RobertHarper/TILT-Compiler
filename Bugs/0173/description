Title:	Master-slave communication could be improved.

Version:	CVS
System:	any
Severity:	cosmetic
Problem:

	structure Comm sometimes replays messages.  It happens with
	multiple slaves on a fast linux box.  The master is currently
	dealing with this by testing for and ignoring spurious messages in
	Master.waitForSlaves.  Slaves ignore the problem.

	The master does not notice if a slave dies.  (TILT does not
	support signals so we can not simply have tell the master "i am
	dying" when it gets interrupted.) Maybe we could detect most slave
	deaths by using sockets to communicate and the file system for an
	initial authentication handshake.

	It would be nice to make communication more efficient.  Leaf
	suggest sending multiple jobs at a time.  If there is one slave,
	send it all available jobs.  Possibly, let the user indicate how
	many jobs a slave can receive at once.  Bumping this number up on
	fast slaves will tend to speed up compilation.
