Problem:
	TILT doesn't allow signature constraints on a structure expression
	which is a functor application. The following is OK in NJ, but gives
	parse errors on lines 3 and 4 in TILT. This is legal ML as far as I
	can tell; see the Definition page 13.


	 1:   functor F (s : sig end) : sig end = s
	  :
	 2:   signature S = sig end
	  :
	 3:   structure X = F (struct end) : sig end
	  :
	 4:   structure Y = F (X) : S
