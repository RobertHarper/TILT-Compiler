Title:       Local definitions don't work in overload declaration.
Keywords:    overloading, phase split
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>
Date:        9/27/00
Version:     CVS
System:	     alpha code gen
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	Using local definitions to define overload expressions as in
	
		local val d = e in overload a : 'a as d end

	does not work.  The phase splitter fails while compiling units
	which depend on d through a.
Code:
	tilt mapfile

Comments:
	This bug only affects the basis library since users should
	not use overload declarations.  In that context, an easy workaround
	is to put the local declaratiosn into a (visible) structure.
	
	This came up while integrating the new prelude into the basis library.
Fix:
	Prelude was changed to not use local for overloads.
