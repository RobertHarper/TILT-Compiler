Title:       Manager linking when unnecessary.
Keywords:    manager, linking
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>
Date:        9/16/00
Version:     CVS
System:	     any
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	The manager will always link, even when no re-compilation was
	necessary and the runtime has not changed.

	Compare the runtime timestamp with an existing exe timestamp
	to determine if linking is necessary -- in the case that
	no units needed GENERATE.
