Title:       Printing from runtime.
Keywords:    runtime, testnig
Submitter:   swasey
Date:        8/15/02
Version:     CVS
System:	     solaris,alpha
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	For the test harness, we need to eliminate any runtime
	messages to stdout in favor of stderr.

	Also, the runtime uses the idiom

		print error message
		assert(0)

	to fail.  We should use abort() rather than assert(0) (which
	is sometimes a noop).  Perhaps we should define a function
	(panic) that both prints and aborts.
