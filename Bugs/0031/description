Title:       Partially supported language extensions.
Keywords:    Frontend
Submitter:   David Swasey <swasey@cs.cmu.edu>

Version:     CVS
System:	     all
Severity:    minor
Problem:
	TILT has partial support for a few extensions.

	* Chris Okasaki's $-extension (Ast.DelayExp, Ast.DelayPat).  We seem
	to elaborate $-expressions and we have a datatype for suspensions in
	the Prelude.  The pattern compiler ignores $-patterns.

	* SML/NJ or-patterns (Ast.OrPat).  Again, the pattern compiler ignores
	them.

	* Abstract structures (Ast.AbsDec).  Toil bails.

	* Functor signatures (Ast.FsigDec).  Toil bails.

	These need to be removed.
