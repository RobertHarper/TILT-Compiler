 * Parser combinators over readers.  These are modeled after the Haskell
 * combinators of Hutton and Meijer.  The main difference is that they
 * return a single result, instead of a list of results.  This means that
 * "or" is a committed choice; once one branch succeeds, the others will not
 * be enabled.  While this is somewhat limiting, for many applications it
 * will not be a problem.  For more substantial parsing problems, one should
 * use ML-Yacc and/or ML-Lex.
