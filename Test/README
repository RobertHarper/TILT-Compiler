TILT's Test directory contains a regression test harness and a suite
of regression tests for the TILT compiler.  See the comment in
runtest.sml for a high-level description of the test harness.  This
file documents the file layout and syntax of individual tests.

We put each test in its own subdirectory of ml96/Test.

The file testlist.txt lists each test by directory and provies a brief
description.  Each line in the file describes one test.

Each test directory has at least the following files:

	mapfile
	result

Loosely speaking, these are the test code and expected test result,
respectively.

The result file is a text file.  The first line must be one of the strings

	Bomb Reject Exit Suicide

In the case of Exit, subsequent lines contain the output expected from
the test code.  (The test code's exit status is ignored.  See
runtest.sml for more information.)

The mapfile is a TILT project description.  The harness will create an
executable containing all the units in this description.

Each test directory should also contain ML source files (referenced by
the mapfile) and documentation, but there are as yet no conventions
governing these.
