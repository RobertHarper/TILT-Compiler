File Layout and Syntax
----------------------

We put each test in its own numbered subdirectory of ml96/Test.

The file testlist.txt lists each test by number and provies a brief
description.

Each test directory should have at least the following files:

	mapfile
	result

Loosely speaking, these are the test code and expected test result.

The result file is a text file.  The first line must be one of the strings

	Bomb Reject Exit Suicide

In the case of Exit, subsequent lines contain the standard output expected
from the test code.  (The test code's standard error is ignored.)

The mapfile is a TILT manager mapfile.  The harness will use TILT to build
it.  If the expected result is not Reject, then the mapfile must define
a target unit named Test.  The unit name is important because the harness
has to find the generated executable (eg, ml96/Test/n/Test.sparc.exe).

A typical test directory will also contain ML source files (referenced
by the mapfile) and any documentation you want to add.
