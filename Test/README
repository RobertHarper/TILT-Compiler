TILT's Test directory contains a regression test harness and a suite
of regression tests for the TILT compiler.  See the comment in
runtest.sml for a high-level description of the test harness.  This
file documents the file layout and syntax of individual tests.

We put each test in its own numbered subdirectory of ml96/Test.

The file testlist.txt lists each test by number and provies a brief
description.  Each line in the file describes one test.

Each test directory has at least the following files:

	mapfile
	result

Loosely speaking, these are the test code and expected test result,
respectively.

The result file is a text file.  The first line must be one of the strings

	Bomb Reject Exit Suicide

In the case of Exit, subsequent lines contain the output (stdout and
stderr) expected from the test code.  (The test code's exit status is
ignored.  See harness.sml for more information.)

The mapfile is a TILT manager mapfile.  The harness will use TILT to build
it.  If the expected result is not Reject, then the mapfile must define
a target unit named Test.  The unit name is important because the harness
has to find the generated executable (eg, ml96/Test/n/Test.sparc.exe).

Each test directory should also contain ML source files (referenced by
the mapfile) and documentation, but there are as yet no conventions
governing these.
