(*
	*BAD TEST*

	This test does not depend on the semantics of ML but on the
	behavior of the manager.  The manager has changed so that it
	is no longer possible to compare two HS signatures by creating
	two interfaces and ascribing them to the same unit.

	IlStatic.Sig_IsEqual used to bomb rather than return false
	when comparing functor signatures.  This test compares
	interfaces I1 and I2.  Since they are unequal, the proper
	result is Reject.

interface I1 = "I1.int" {}
unit A : I1

interface I2 = "I2.int" {}
import unit A : I2
