Take a look at bug.sig and bug.int.

The elaborator rejected the interface

	functor F (Arg : S1) : S2
		where B.C = Arg

but accepted the interface

	functor F (Arg : S1) : S2
		where type B.C.t = Arg.t

The problem was in the helper constrain in
Signature.xsig_where_structure_slow.  It followed the labels labs
(B.C.t) to find labels labs' (A.t) which it assumed had the form
B.C.plabs' where plabs' is non-empty.  This assumption is false and
led to a spurious "where's rhs structure missing components" error
when constrain tried to lookup plabs'.

The fix was to use the argument plabs (t) in place of plabs'.  This
led to a problem with datatype labels; see ../Test/0025.
