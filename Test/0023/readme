TILT should reject this project unit FrontEnd does not elaborate.
TILT used to bomb in the coercion compiler while elaborating FrontEnd.

The functor JoinWithArg argument signature is

	[pos > pos1 : TYPE,
	 ParserData :
		[pos > pos2 : TYPE = pos1,
		 Actions : [actions : pos2]]]

The actual structure supplied to JoinWithArg has signature

	[ParserData :
		[pos > argpos1 : TYPE,
		 Actions : [actions : argpos1]],
	 pos > argpos2 : TYPE = int]

Coercion proceeds (in Signature.xcoerce_structure) by changing the
bound variables in the target signature to match those in the actual
signature and then trying to coerce each target label, in turn.  After
coercion of ParserData.pos fails (as it should), TILT printed an error
message and continued to ParserData.Actions.actions to look for other
errors.  At this point, the elaborator bombed because the variable
pos2/argpos1 was not bound.  The problem was that
Signature.xcoerce_structure only extended the context after a
successful coercion.  The fix was to extend the context with the
target sdec after a failed coercion.
