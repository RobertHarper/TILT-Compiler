This is TILT version 1.0.

This release is set up to compile TILT using SML/NJ 110.0.7 available
from

	http://www.smlnj.org/

The architectures and operating systems supported by TILT are listed
in the manual page (Doc/tilt.txt).  Take a look at the comments and
commands in Makefile and Runtime/Makefile and then try

	make

to compile TILT.  The scripts Bin/tilt and Bin/tilt-nj will run TILT
out of the current directory; alternatively, you can use

	su
	make install

to copy binaries to the directory PREFIX set in Makefile.
