INSTALLING TILT
---------------

This release is set up to compile TILT using SML/NJ 110.0.3 or 110.0.7
available from

	http://www.smlnj.org/

The architectures and operating systems supported by TILT are listed
in the manual page (Doc/tilt.txt).  Take a look at the comments and
commands in Makefile and Runtime/Makefile and then try

	make

to compile TILT.  On unsupported platforms, the final message will be
"tilt: unable to link".  This is expected: TILT cross-compiled but did
not generate any object files.

Once make has finished, the scripts Bin/tilt and Bin/tilt-nj will run
TILT out of the current directory; alternatively, you can use

	su
	make install

to copy binaries to the directory PREFIX set in Makefile.


PARALLEL MAKE
-------------

If your machine is fast and has plenty of memory, then you can
speed up the installation of TILT by doing the following instead
of "make".

1. Compile TILT with SML/NJ:

	make heap

2. Launch a few compilation slaves:

	./Bin/tilt-slaves -n 3/localhost

If you do not get a window running emacs with three buffers named
*tilt slave n*, then you can either fix ./Bin/tilt-slave (not
tilt-slaves) for your site or run the slaves manually by opening new
windows and executing

	./Bin/tilt-nj -s

in the current directory.

3. Now run

	make

to compile TILT.  The slaves will contribute to the TILT compilation
jobs that make starts.


CVS ACCESS
----------

For faster access to bugs (and bug fixes), you can pull TILT from our
CVS server:

	cvs -d :pserver:guest_tilt@cvs.concert.cs.cmu.edu:/cvsroot login
	# Use an empty password

	cvs -d :pserver:guest_tilt@cvs.concert.cs.cmu.edu:/cvsroot checkout ml96

The CVS repository contains a few things that are not in the release:
an old MLRISC backend, some experimental code, regression tests,
benchmarks, a bugs database, additional (and outdated) documentation,
and a port of twelf 1.2.
