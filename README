INSTALLING TILT

	This release is set up to compile TILT using SML/NJ 110.0.7
	available from

		http://www.smlnj.org/

	TILT supports the SPARC V9 and Alpha architectures running SunOS
	5.5.1, SunOS 5.7, SunOS 5.8, and Digital Unix V4.0D but can run on
	any Unix system supported by SML/NJ.  Unsupported architectures
	can be used as compilation slaves (for any supported architecture)
	but TILT can not generate binaries for them.

	Take a look at the comments and commands in Makefile and
	Runtime/Makefile and then try

		make

	to compile TILT.  On unsupported architectures, the final message
	will be "tilt: unable to link".

	Once make has finished, the scripts Bin/tilt and Bin/tilt-nj will
	run TILT out of the current directory; alternatively, you can use

		su
		make install

	to copy binaries to the directory PREFIX set in Makefile.


PARALLEL MAKE

	If your machine is fast and has plenty of memory, then you can
	speed up the installation of TILT by running extra compilation
	slaves.

	Use "make with-slaves" rather than "make".  If the script
	./Bin/tilt-slave works on your platform, then when once make
	compiles TILT under SML/NJ, you will see a new window running
	emacs with four buffers named *tilt slave n*.  The slaves will
	contribute to the TILT compilation jobs that make starts.

	An alternative that does not rely on the script ./Bin/tilt-slave
	is to compile TILT under SML/NJ and then run TILT slaves by hand:

	1.  Compile TILT with SML/NJ:

		make heap

	2.  Open a new window and run

		./Bin/tilt-nj -s

	in the current directory.  You can do this a few times.

	3.  If you are compiling on a network file system and have spare
	machines you want to use as slaves, then repeat steps (1) and (2)
	on those machines.

	4.  Run

		make

	to compile TILT.  The slaves will contribute to the TILT
	compilation jobs that make starts.
