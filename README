This is TILT version 1.1.

TILT is a compiler for Standard ML that uses Typed Intermediate
Languages.  It can make executables and libraries for the SPARC V9 and
Intel x86 architectures running SunOS 5.5.1, SunOS 5.7, SunOS 5.8,
SunOS 5.9, and linux.  Tilt is a version of the compiler compiled by
TILT.  Tilt-nj is a version of the compiler compiled by Standard ML of
New Jersey; it should run on any Unix system supported by SML/NJ.
(Such machines can be used as compilation slaves even if TILT can not
generate binaries for them.)

The files Doc/tilt.txt and Doc/tilt-project.txt describe the
command-line interface to TILT and the compilation manager.  The Doc
directory also contains PostScript versions of these files.

The file License/CMU contains TILT's copyright notice, permission
notice, and disclaimer.

INSTALLING TILT

The TILT sources compile under SML/NJ version 110.0.7 and under TILT.
To get started, you need SML/NJ available from

	http://www.smlnj.org/

Ensure that the script Bin/smlnj has the correct path to the SML/NJ
compiler.  If you are attempting to compile with some other SML
compiler, then you will probably need to modify our CM files, the
script Bin/mkheap used to generate SML/NJ heaps, and perhaps some of
the TILT code to account for Basis library changes.

On the Intel x86, a modified version of TAL 3.0 is required.  It is
available from

	http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fox/tilt.html

TAL requires Objective Caml available from

	http://caml.inria.fr/

and has been built with OCaml versions 3.07.2 and 3.08.3.  Ensure that
Runtime/talx86/Makefile has the correct path to your TAL root
directory and that TAL has been compiled (with "make") prior to
compiling TILT.

Ensure that the script Bin/cputype prints sparc, talx86, or
unsupported.

Take a look at the commands in Makefile, Runtime/talx86/Makefile, and
Runtime/sparc/Makefile and then try

	make

to compile TILT.  On unsupported architectures, the final message will
be "tilt: unable to link".

Once make has finished, the scripts Bin/tilt and Bin/tilt-nj will run
TILT out of the current directory.  Alternatively, you can use

	su

	make install

to install TILT into the directory PREFIX set in Makefile.  This
copies binaries to PREFIX/lib/tilt, manual pages to PREFIX/man, and
wrapper scripts to PREFIX/bin.  The installed wrapper scripts run TILT
from RUNPREFIX/lib/tilt rather than PREFIX/lib/tilt.


PARALLEL MAKE

If your machine has multiple CPUs and has plenty of memory, then you
can speed up the installation of TILT by running extra compilation
slaves.

Use "make with-slaves" rather than "make".  If the script
Bin/tilt-slave works on your platform, then when once make compiles
TILT under SML/NJ, you will see a new window running emacs with four
buffers named *tilt slave n*.  The slaves will contribute to the TILT
compilation jobs that make starts.

An alternative that does not rely on the script Bin/tilt-slave is to
compile TILT under SML/NJ and then run TILT slaves by hand:

	1.  Compile TILT with SML/NJ:

		make heap

	2.  Open a new window and run

		./Bin/tilt-nj -s

	in the current directory.  You can do this a few times.

	3.  If you are compiling on a network file system and have spare
	machines you want to use as slaves, then repeat steps (1) and (2)
	on those machines.

	4.  Run

		make

	to compile TILT.  The slaves will contribute to the TILT
	compilation jobs that make starts.


INCOMPATIBILITIES

TILT has some incompatibilities with Standard ML and some extensions.

The value restriction used by TILT is different than that specified in
SML.  TILT treats declarations like "val a = e1 and b = e2" as a
derived forms for declarations like "val (a,b) = (e1,e2)".  A variable
in a val declaration will only be generalized if the right hand side
is a value and the variable does not occur in the argument of a
datatype constructor.

TILT does not support non-uniform datatypes.  Specifically, in a
strongly-connected datbind of the form

	tyvarseq1 tycon1 = conbind1

	...

	tyvarseqn tyconn = conbindn

TILT requires that no tyvarseq contains duplicates; there exists k
such that every tyvarseq has length k; and for each application tyseq
tyconi occurring in conbindj, tyseq = tyvarseqj.  For example, TILT
rejects "datatype 'a t = T of int t" but accepts "datatype 'a t = T of
'a t".

TILT implements an extension to structure sharing specifications (that
is, "spec sharing longstrid1 = ...  longstridn") that is likely to be
incompatible with the extensions implemented by other SML compilers.
The file Doc/structure_sharing.txt describes the structure sharing
extension planned for a future version of TILT.

TILT supports signature expression of the form "sigexp where
longstrid1 = longstrid2" as a shorthand for a series of type
realizations.


PLANS

Future versions of TILT will include bug fixes, performance
enhancements, a new structure sharing extension, and an updated Basis
library.  See the file KNOWN_BUGS lists known bugs.
