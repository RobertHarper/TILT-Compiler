This file collects examples demonstrating the use of "load.sml" to run
the compiler.

Set the environment variable TILT_LIBDIR to the root of the ml96
hierarchy:

	csh% setenv TILT_LIBDIR `pwd`
	sh$ TILT_LIBDIR=`pwd`; export TILT_LIBDIR

Run SML/NJ with "sml"; all of the examples below should be entered at
the SML/NJ prompt "-".

use "load.sml";	(* compile TILT and the Load interface with NJ *)
Load.toExe();	(* arrange for TILT to generate executables *)
		(* see load.sml for other options *)
Boot.boot();	(* compile Basis with TILT *)
Manager.make "mapfile-all";
		(* compile TILT with TILT *)
Manager.make "Bench/mapfile-timings";
		(* compile benchmarks with TILT *)

A brief introduction to TILT's compilation manager is Doc/tilt.1 (a
manual page).  More details can be found in Doc/TM.txt.
